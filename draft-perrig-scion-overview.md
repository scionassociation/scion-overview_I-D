--- abstract

The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic expectations and is intertwined with many aspects of our society. Unfortunately, the security of todayâ€™s Internet is far from commensurate with its importance as critical infrastructure. Additionally, the Internet has not primarily been built for high availability in the presence of adversaries, and recent proposals to improve Internet security and availability have been constrained by the setup of the current architecture.

The next-generation inter-network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) aims to address the above-mentioned issues. SCION was explicitly designed from the outset to offer availability and security by default. The architecture provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communication. It also enables multi-path routing between hosts.

This document discusses the motivations behind the SCION architecture and gives a high-level overview of its fundamental components, including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and data plane. As SCION is already in production use today, the document concludes with an overview of SCION deployments.

# Introduction

The Internet has been incredibly successful as it grew to a planet-scale network with billions of devices. But although this world-wide communication system guarantees global reachability, it falls short of providing other properties that are in demand today. These shortcomings of the current Internet are the reason for developing SCION: To make the Internet more secure, reliable, transparent, and scalable.

The Introduction section explores the motivation to develop SCION, followed by a short description of SCION's main elements. The sections after the Introduction provide deeper insight into SCION's key concepts, features and deployment scenarios. The document concludes with some concrete case studies where SCION has been successfully deployed in production.

## Why SCION - Motivation {#why}

Since its introduction back in the 1980s, the Internet has never stopped to expand. As a consequence, the global network continually needs to accommodate new uses. This has brought many issues to light, including a lack of transparency and control, poor scalability, occurrences of severe outages, weak fault isolation, and energy consumption. As the Internet has not been built with security in mind, the lack thereof is another problem. Because of this, the current Internet offers little protection against attacks such as spoofing, prefix- and DNS-hijacking, denial-of-service, and combinations of these. For more background information, see {{SCHUCHARD2011}}, {{LABOVITZ2000}}, {{GRIFFIN1999}}, {{SAHOO2009}}, and {{RFC4264}}.

Up until now, there have been numerous initiatives to address the above issues (e.g., {{RFC4033}}, {{RFC6480}}, {{RFC8205}}, and {{RFC8446}}). Although these initiatives have brought many improvements, concerns regarding security and scalability still remain (see, for example, {{LYCHEV2013}}, {{LI2014}}, {{COOPER2013}}, {{ROTHENBERGER2017}}, and {{MORILLO2021}}). Also other requirements that users have of today's Internet are not fulfilled yet (see, among others, [draft-king-irtf-challenges-in-routing](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-king-irtf-challenges-in-routing/)). This especially pertains to the demands of enterprises globally exchanging sensitive information with an ecosystem, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, universities, multinationals, governments, critical and transportation infrastructure operators.

These users require the Internet to be highly available at all times and constantly perform on a high level. They expect reliable operation of the global network also in case of failures, by the use of multi-path routing. They want to send their sensitive data packets over secure and trustworthy networking infrastructure, and therefore prefer to select themselves the path their data will take. They also need availability guarantees across multiple routing domains, even in the presence of attacks. They further want to rely on an Internet that can be multilaterally governed and is free from global kill-switches. In short, today's users of the Internet seek performance, control, reliability, security and trust.

SCION has been developed in order to meet the above-mentioned requirements. SCION aims to reach the following goals:

- Address the Internet's fundamental issues by offering
  - high availability also in the presence of adversaries,
  - fast failover in the case of faulty connections, and
  - prevention from hijacking, DoS, and other attacks.
- Make the Internet more transparent and efficient.
- Improve the Internet's scalability.
- Prepare the Internet for tomorrow's applications, such as virtual reality, Internet of Things (IoT), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

**Note**: A more detailed motivation for developing SCION will be described in a separate gap analysis internet draft.

### Formal Verification

An additional feature of SCION is its formal verification. The SCION network system consists of a variety of components such as routers, servers, and edge devices. Such a complex system eludes the mental capacities of human beings for considering all possible states and interactions. That is why SCION includes a formal verification framework developed by the Department of Computer Science of the ETH Zurich {{KLENZE2021}}. This guarantees that packet forwarding and SCION's authentication mechanisms are correct and consistent.

### Avoiding Pitfalls

Of course SCION is not the first concept that addresses the Internet's networking issues. But unfortunately many other promising solutions for the Internet's problems have never managed to succeed, for reasons described in {{RFC9049}}. SCION, however, avoids the pitfalls mentioned in this document. For example, SCION does not have to be adopted by the entire Internet to be effective: The routing architecture provides benefits already to early adapters. Even if only a small part of the global network works with SCION, adapters will still take advantage of using the SCION routing technology. Moreover, not only users of SCION benefit from it, also ISPs and operators benefit from deploying SCION: early deployments showed that providers can charge the use of SCION as premium connectivity, with users who are willing to pay for it. Furthermore, SCION can be installed on top of and function alongside the existing routing infrastructure and protocols--there is no need for bigger changes in an operational network.

The above points facilitate the deployment of SCION and increase its acceptance. The several cases where SCION is already successfully implemented today illustrate this (see the section [Deployments](#deploy)).

### Why Now?

SCION can be considered a _path-aware internetworking_ architecture, as described in {{RFC9217}}. This RFC, which was published in March of this year (2022), poses (open) questions that must be answered in order to realize such a path-aware networking architecture. It was originally written to frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in this space.

SCION clearly provides answers to the questions raised in this RFC. This especially pertains to the second, third, seventh, and eighth question:

- How do endpoints and applications get access to accurate, useful, and trustworthy path properties?
- How can endpoints select paths to use for traffic in a way that can be trusted by the network, the endpoints, and the applications using them?
- How can a path-aware network in a path-aware internetwork be effectively operated, given control inputs from network administrators, application designers, and end users?
- How can the incentives of network operators and end users be aligned to realize the vision of path-aware networking, and how can the transition from current ("path-oblivious") to path-aware networking be managed?

The answers to these questions can be found in the sections [Key Concepts]({#key}) and [Deployments]({#deploy}), respectively.

Another RFC that must be mentioned in the context of this draft is {{RFC5218}}, "What Makes for a Successful Protocol?". SCION fulfils most factors that contribute to the success of a protocol, as described in section 2.1 of the RFC. This includes such factors as offering a positive net value (i.e., the benefits of deploying SCION outweigh the costs), incremental deployability, and open source code availability. More importantly, SCION averts the failure criteria mentioned in section 1.4 of the RFC: SCION is already deployed and in use by many actors of the Swiss financial and academic ecosystems, and mainstream implementation of SCION is possible, too.

To conclude: The time is ripe to take SCION to the IETF, in order to contribute to the important discussion regarding path-aware networking, and to make a first step towards standardization.


## SCION Overview

SCION has been designed to address the fundamental issues of today's Internet depicted in the previous section [Why SCION - Motivation](#why). This section gives a high-level description of SCION's main elements, providing a basic understanding of this next-generation inter-network architecture.

### Network Architecture and Naming

SCION's main goal is to offer highly available and efficient inter-domain packet deliveryâ€”even in the presence of actively malicious entities. To achieve scalability and sovereignty, SCION organizes existing ASes into groups of independent routing planes, called **Isolation Domains (ISD)**. An AS can be a member of multiple ISDs. All ASes in an ISD agree on a set of trust roots, called the **Trust Root Configuration (TRC)**, ensuring that network traffic only flows on policy-compliant paths. The ISD is governed by a set of **core ASes**, which provide connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust roots. Typically, the 3â€“10 largest ASes of an ISD form the ISDâ€™s core.

Isolation domains serve the following purposes:

- They allow SCION to support trust heterogeneity, as each ISD can independently define its roots of trust;
- They provide transparency for trust relationships;
- They isolate the routing process within an ISD from external influences such as attacks and misconfigurations; and
- They improve the scalability of the routing protocol by separating it into a process within and one between ISDs.

ISDs provide natural isolation of routing failures and misconfigurations, give endpoints strong control over both inbound and outbound traffic, provide meaningful and enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates with high path-freshness.


**Links**

There are three types of links in SCION: core links, parent-child links, and peering links.

- A **core link** can only exist between two core ASes.
- A **parent-child link** requires that at least one of the two connected ASes is a non-core AS. ASes with a parent-child link usually belong to the same entity or have a provider-customer relationship.
- A **peering link** also includes at least one non-core AS. A peering link exists between ASes with a (standard or paid) relationship.

See {{architecture}} for a high-level overview of the SCION network structure.

### Routing

SCION operates on two routing levels: intra-ISD and inter-ISD. As a path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available network path segments through **path-segment construction beacons (PCBs)**. A PCB is initiated by a core AS and then disseminated either within an ISD (to explore intra-ISD paths) or among core ASes (to explore core paths across different ISDs). The PCBs accumulate cryptographically protected path- and forwarding information on AS-level, and store this information in the form of **hop fields (HFs)**. End hosts use the information from these PCBs/hop fields to create end-to-end forwarding paths for data packets, who carry this information in their packet headers. This concept is called **packet-carried forwarding state (PCFS)**. The concept also supports multi-path communication among end hosts.

The process of creating an end-to-end forwarding path consists of the following steps:

1. First, an AS discovers paths to other ASes, during the *path exploration* (or beaconing) phase.
2. The AS then selects a few PCBs according to defined policies, transforms the selected PCBs into path segments, and registers these segments with a path infrastructure, thus making them available to other ASes. This happens during the *path registration* phase.
3. During the *path resolution* phase, the actual creation of an end-to-end forwarding path to the destination takes place. For this, an end host performs
      a. a *path lookup* step, to obtain path segments, and
      b. a *path combination* step, to combine the forwarding path from the segments.

#### ISD and AS numbering

SCION decouples end-host addressing from inter-domain routing. Routing is based on the <ISD, AS> tuple, agnostic of end-host addressing. Existing AS numbers are inherited from the current Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for additional SCION AS numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today. The end host local address is not used for inter-domain routing or forwarding, does not need to be globally unique, and can thus be an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example. A SCION address is therefore composed of the <ISD, AS, local address> 3-tuple.


### Infrastructure Components

The **beacon service**, the **path service**, and the **certificate service** are the main infrastructure components within a SCION AS. Each service can be deployed redundantly, depending on the AS's size and type. It is also possible to combine the services into one or more _control services_. _Internal routers_ forward packets inside the AS, while _border routers_ provide interconnectivity between ASes.

- The _beacon service_ discovers path information. It is responsible for generating, receiving, and propagating PCBs. Periodically, the beacon service generates a set of PCBs, which are forwarded to its child ASes or neighboring core ASes. The PCBs are flooded over policy-compliant paths to discover multiple paths between any pair of core ASes.
- The _path service_ stores mappings from AS identifiers to sets of announced path segments. The path service is organized as a hierarchical caching system similar to that of DNS. Through the beacon service, ASes select the set of path segments through which they want to be reached, and they register them to the path service in the ISD core.
- The _certificate service_ keeps cached copies of certificates and manages keys and certificates for securing inter-AS communication. The certificate service is queried by the beacon service when validating the authenticity of PCBs (i.e., when the beacon service lacks a certificate).

_Border routers_ are deployed at the edge of SCION ASes. The main task of border routers is to forward packets to a neighbor border router or the destination host within the AS. While SCION takes care of intra-domain routing, it relies on existing routing protocols (e.g., IS-IS, OSPF, SDN) and communication fabric (e.g., IP, MPLS) for intra-domain forwarding. _Internal routers_, therefore, do not need to be changed to support SCION.


## Conventions and Definitions

# Key Concepts {#key}

This section explains the SCION key concepts, including authentication, control- and data plane.

## Authentication

SCION's control plane relies on a public-key infrastructure called the **control-plane PKI (CP-PKI)**, which is organized on ISD-level. Each ISD can independently build its own roots of trust, defined in a file called **trust root configuration (TRC)**.  

**Note**: This section describes the SCION authentication concept on a very high level. A much more detailed description of SCION's authentication will follow in a separate internet draft.


### The Control-Plane PKI (CP-PKI)

Trust within each isolation domain is anchored in the TRC file. Each TRC contains a collection of signed root certificates, which are used to sign CA certificates, which are in turn used to sign AS certificates. The TRC also includes ISD-policies that specify, for example, the TRC's usage, validity, and future updates. {{chain}} illustrates this. TRCs are the main components of the CP-PKI.

The initial TRC in an ISD is called the **base TRC**. This base TRC constitutes the ISD's trust anchor. It is signed during a signing ceremony and then distributed throughout the ISD. All entities within the ISD obtain the initial TRC with an offline mechanism such as a USB flash drive provided by the ISP, or with an online mechanism that relies on a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approach. However, all updates to the base TRCs are performed in a straightforward process that does not require any manual or out-of-band action (such as a software update) (see [TRC Update and Verification](#update)).

{{chain}} shows the TRC trust chain and associated certificates. TRC 1 is the base TRC, and TRC 2 and 3 constitute updates to this base TRC. TRC 2 must be verified using the voting certificates in TRC 1. Control-plane (CP) root certificates are used to verify other CP certificates (which are in turn used to verify PCBs).

Each SCION AS must hold a private key (to sign PCBs) and a certificate attesting that it is the rightful owner of the corresponding public key. One of the main roles of the TRC is thus enabling the verification of **AS certificates** and PCBs.

### TRC Update and Verification {#update}

With a base TRC as trust anchor, TRCs can be updated in a verifiable manner. There are two kinds of TRC updates: regular and sensitive updates. A _regular_ TRC update happens when the TRC's validity period expires. This period is defined by the _validity_ parameter in the TRC. The default is one year. A TRC update is _sensitive_ if and only if critical sections of the TRC are affected (for example, if the set of core ASes is modified). For both regular and sensitive TRC updates, a number of votes (in the form of signatures) must be cast to approve the update. This number of votes is dictated by the voting quorum and set in each TRC with the _voting quorum_ parameter.


### Dissemination of TRC Updates

Information about a TRC update is disseminated via the SCIONâ€™s beaconing process. Each PCB contains the version number of the currently active TRC. If an AS receives a PCB with a TRC version number higher than the locally stored TRC, it requests the PCB-sending AS for the new TRC. The new TRC is verified on the basis of the current one, and is accepted if it contains at least the required quorum of correct signatures by trust roots defined in the current TRC.
This simple dissemination mechanism has two advantages: It is very efficient (as fresh PCBs rapidly reach all ASes), and it avoids circular dependencies with regard to the verification of PCBs and the beaconing process itself (as no server needs to be contacted over unknown paths in order to fetch the updated TRC).


### Grace Period

At most two TRCs per ISD can be active at the same time. The TRC parameter _grace period_ indicates for how long the currently active TRC can still be active after a new TRC is disseminated. This so-called **grace period** starts at the beginning of the validity period of the new TRC. An older TRC can only be considered active until either (1) the grace period has passed, or (2) yet a newer TRC is announced. AS certificates are validated by following the chain of trust up to an active TRC.


### Revocation and Recovery from a Catastrophic Event

The TRC dissemination mechanism also enables rapid revocation of trust roots. When a trust root is compromised, the other trust roots can remove it from the TRC and disseminate a new TRC alongside a PCB with a new version number.

In case of a catastrophic eventâ€”such as several private root keys being disclosed due to a critical vulnerability in a cryptographic libraryâ€”SCION is equipped with a recovery procedure called **trust reset**. The procedure consists of creating a new TRC with fresh trustworthy keys (and potentially new algorithms), and redistributing this TRC out-of-band. A trust reset effectively establishes a new base TRC for the ISD.
It is possible for ISDs to disable trust resets by setting the _no trust reset_ Boolean parameter to "true" in their TRC, with the effect that the entire ISD would have to be abandoned in the event of such a catastrophic compromise (this abandonment would also have to be announced out of band).

The partition of the SCION network into ISDs guarantees that no single entity can take down the entire network. Even if several entities formed a coalition to carry out an attack, the effects of that attack would be limited to one or a few ISDs. Moreover, all actions are publicly visible, which deters misbehavior.

## Control Plane

The control plane is responsible for discovering path segments and making them available to end hosts, together with the certificates needed to verify those path segments. This process includes path exploration, registration, and lookup. In SCION, the exploration of paths segments is called **beaconing**, and the main actors are the **path-segment construction beacons**, or PCBs.


### Path Exploration and Registration

The path segment construction process is referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path segments. Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by reversing the order of ASes in a segment. The beaconing process in each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks. There are three types of path segments:

- A path segment from a non-core AS to the core is an up-segment.
- A path segment from the core to a non-core AS is a down-segment.
- A path segment between core ASes is a core-segment.

However, path segments are typically bidirectional and thus support packet forwarding in both directions. In other words, up-segments and down- segments are invertible: An up-segment can be converted to a down-segment and vice versa. The path service in non-core ASes learns up-segments by extracting them from PCBs they obtain from the local beacon service. Path services in core ASes obtain down-segments when they are registered by beacon services in non-core ASes and in addition store core-segments to reach other core ASes.

An AS typically receives several PCBs representing several path segments to various core ASes.

Core beaconing enables core ASes to learn paths to other core ASes. Through intra-ISD beaconing, non-core ASes learn path segments leading to core ASes (and vice versa).

Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and down-path segments.

Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between core ASes. During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other neighboring core ASes.

Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy, which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes. For this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors (typically customer ASes). Each non-core AS propagates the received PCBs to its respective customers. This procedure continues until the PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD. Non-core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the same peering link.

The beaconing process is asynchronous: Each AS can independently set policies dictating which PCBs are sent in which time intervals, and to which neighbors. In particular, PCBs do not need to be propagated immediately upon arrival. However, during bootstrapping and in case a PCB containing a previously unknown path is obtained, it should be forwarded immediately such that other ASes learn about it quickly.

Figure 2.5 shows how PCBs originate from the core beacon service and are propagated to non-core child ASes. The non-core beacon service receives these PCBs and re-sends them to child ASes, which results in AS-level path segments. At every AS, metadata as well as information about the ingress and egress interfaces (i.e., link identifiers) of the AS is added to the PCB.

Paths at AS-level granularity are insufficient for diversity; ASes often have several connection points, and thus a disjoint path is possible despite the AS sequence being identical. For this reason, SCION encodes AS ingress and egress interfaces in the form of interface IDs as part of the path, exposing a finer level of path diversity. These interface IDs identify connections to neighboring ASes and can be chosen and encoded by each AS independently and without any need for coordination as the IDs only need to be unique within each AS. Figure 2.5 demonstrates this feature: AS F receives two different PCBs via two different links from a core AS. Moreover, AS F uses two different links to send two different PCBs to AS G, each containing the respective egress interfaces. AS G extends the two PCBs and forwards both of them over a single link to a child AS.



             Figure 2.5: Intra-ISD PCB propagation from the ISD core down to child ASes. For the sake of illustration, the interfaces of each AS are numbered with integer values. In practice, each AS can choose any encoding for its interfaces; in fact, only the AS itself needs to understand its encoding.


The beacon service in an AS selects the down-segments through which the AS desires to be reached, and registers these path segments at the core path service. When links fail, segments expire, or better segments become available, the beacon service keeps updating the down-segments registered for their AS.

To address the sub-optimality of hierarchical routing, SCION introduces peering links and shortcuts. In a shortcut, a path only contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at a non-core AS that is common to both paths. Peering links can be added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar to todayâ€™s Internet.

Peering links are of paramount importance for an efficient Internet and to implement the existing economic relationships between ISPs. Therefore, SCION has a built-in mechanism for peering links between two non-core ASes or between a core AS and a non-core AS. To reduce beaconing overhead and prevent possible forwarding loops, PCBs do not traverse peering links. Instead, peer- ing links are announced along with a regular path in a PCB. Figure 2.5 shows how AS F includes its two peering links in the PCB. If the same peering link is announced in the path segments by both ASes adjacent to the peering link, then the peering link can be used to shortcut the end-to-end path (i.e., with- out going through the core). SCION also supports peering links that cross ISD boundaries, which also adheres to SCIONâ€™s path transparency property: A source knows the exact set of ASes and ISDs traversed during the delivery of a packet.

A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path segments. Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control service. The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where information is fetched on-demand only. A core ASâ€™s path server stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.


### Path Lookup

An end host (source) who wants to start communication with another host (destination), requires up to three path segments: An up-segment to reach the ISD core, a core-segment to reach the destination ISD, and a down-segment to reach the destination AS. The source host queries the path service in its AS for such segments. The path service has up-segments stored in its database and furthermore checks if it has appropriate core- and down-segments in its cache; in this case it returns them immediately.

If not, the path service in the source AS queries core path services (using locally stored up-segments) in the source ISD for core-segments to the destination ISD. Then, it combines up-segments with the newly retrieved core-segments to query core path services in the remote ISD to fetch remote down-segments. To improve overall efficiency the local path service caches the returned path segments and uses parallelism when requesting path segments from core path services. Finally, the local path service returns all path segments to the source host.

This recursive lookup strongly simplifies the process for end hosts (which only have to send a single query, similar to stub DNS resolvers). The caching strategy ensures that path lookups are fast for frequently used destinations (similar to caching in recursive DNS resolvers).

> Example. Consider a source host in ISD 1 sending a path lookup request to its local path service. If the destination AS is within ISD 1, the local path service queries the core path services in ISD 1 for down-segments. Each core path service responds returning down-segments to the local path service. If needed, the local path service also requests intra-ISD core-segments to connect up- and down-segments that do not start and end in the same core AS. The local path service then returns the set of up-, down-, and (potentially) core-segments to the source. If the destination AS is in ISD 2, then the local path service first requests core-segments to ISD 2 from the core path services in ISD 1. Combining the returned core-segments with the existing up-segments, the local path service then requests down-segments from core path services in ISD 2. Finally, the set of up-, core- and down-segments is returned to the requesting source. All path segments learned by the local path service are cached.

### PCB and Path-Segment Selection

Among the received PCBs, ASes must choose a set of PCBs to propagate further, and a set of path segments to register. These PCBs and path segments are selected based on a path quality metric with the goal of identifying consistent, diverse, efficient, and policy-compliant paths. Consistency refers to the requirement that there exists at least one property along which the path is uniform, such as an AS capability (e.g., support for COLIBRI or link property (e.g., high bandwidth). Diversity refers to the set of paths that are announced over time being as path-disjoint as possible to provide high- quality multipath options. Efficiency refers to the length, bandwidth, latency, utilization, and availability of a path, where more efficient paths are naturally preferred. Policy compliance refers to the requirement that the path adheres to the ASâ€™s routing policy. Based on past PCBs that were sent, the beacon service scores the current set of candidate path segments and sends the best segments in the next beaconing interval.

Core beaconing operates similarly to intra-ISD beaconing, except that core PCBs only traverse core ASes. The same path selection metrics apply, where an AS attempts to forward the set of most desirable paths to its neighbors. A difference, however, is that each AS forwards a number of PCBs per source AS. This process, which is similar to how BGP operates, is susceptible to scalability issues as the overhead grows linearly with the number of core ASes. However, as shown by the scalability analysis in Â§6.3, on a per-path basis SCIONâ€™s diversity-based beaconing algorithm (Â§4.4.6) is around two orders of magnitude more efficient than BGP due to the following reasons: SCION beaconing does not need to iteratively converge, SCION makes AS-based announcements instead of BGPâ€™s prefix-based announcements (there are around 10 times more prefixes than ASes in todayâ€™s Internet), and diversity-based beaconing is optimized to reduce the number of transmitted beacons.

### Link Failures

Unlike in the current Internet, link failures are not automatically resolved by the network, but require active handling by end hosts. Since SCION forward- ing paths are static, they break when one of the links fails. Link failures are handled by a two-pronged approach that typically masks link failures without any outage to the application and rapidly re-establishes fresh working paths:

- The SCION Control Message Protocol (SCMP) (the SCION equivalent of ICMP) is used for signaling connectivity problems. Instead of relying on application- or transport-layer timeouts, end hosts get immediate feedback from the network if a path stops working and can quickly switch to an alternative path.
- SCION end hosts are encouraged to use multipath communication by default, thus masking a link failure with another working path. As multipath communication can increase availability (even in environments with very limited path choices [24]), SCION beacon services attempt to create disjoint paths, SCION path services attempt to select and announce disjoint paths, and end hosts compose path segments to achieve maximum resilience to path failure. Consequently, most link failures in SCION remain unnoticed by the application [235], unlike the frequent (albeit mostly brief) outages in the current Internet [285, 307].



## Data Plane

Name resolution in SCION returns the <ISD, AS, local address> 3-tuple. Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the <ISD, AS> tuple. Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with the received core- and down-path segments.

Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment. Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent unauthorized path combinations.

The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS. The hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path alteration. This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS) replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need any local state on either paths or flows.
