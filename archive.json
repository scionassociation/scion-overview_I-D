      "body": "We decided to omit a detailed gap analysis in the initial version of this draft. Based on IETF feedback in the first interim meeting and at IETF 114, it might not be worthwhile to write a dedicated gap analysis draft. This is because SCION is already there, and it is already designed. A discussion on where the gaps are might not bring too much of a benefit. \r\n\r\nWe had a list of current Internet issues in [this commit](https://github.com/scionfoundation/scion-overview_I-D/commit/8259808cbbd41e8c1d8e39eb7ffc63b8d516433c) that we then removed. This list  could be handy for a more thorough motivation & gap analysis. \r\n\r\nAlso, we have the text below that could be used\r\n\r\n```\r\nFor example, as highlighted in {{I-D.rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement}}, achieving reliable inter-domain Internet connectivity remains an open challenge for cloud providers.\r\n\r\n  I-D.rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement:\r\n    title: SCION Overview\r\n    date: 2022\r\n    target: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement/\r\n    author:\r\n      -\r\n        ins: L. Dunbar\r\n      -\r\n        ins: A. Malis\r\n      -\r\n        ins: C. Jacquenet\r\n      -\r\n        ins: M. Toy\r\n      -\r\n        ins: K. Majumdar\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nThe relevance of Internet's routing security issues is testified by the fact that these issues now have the attention of policymakers, while previously they were only well known in industry and academia. One example is the 2022 FCC inquiry on routing security {{FCC2022}}.\r\n\r\n  FCC2022:\r\n    title: Notice of Inquiry on Secure Internet Routing\r\n    date: 2022\r\n    target: https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-inquiry-internet-routing-vulnerabilities\r\n    author:\r\n      ins: Federal Communications Commission\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIMHO (@nicorusti ), it is worth to incorporate these into the draft. \r\n\r\nAlso, we will have to improve descriptions of the deployment model, either in this draft, or in the component analysis draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

I can eventually help with the deployment section\r\n- I noticed that a lot of times we use \"we\". I see that some IETF drafts also use it, but not so often. I feel that using it a lot creates a bit of a \"divide\" between what our vision is, and what others might perceive... I think this is good when writing a paper/book (because authors want to stress that they are presenting their vision), but perhaps a more neutral language is more appropriate here, as our goal is to get consensus and to have our solution as widely accepted as possible. Not something super important, but had these thoughts in mind.  ",

In the following, we discuss several practical deployment approaches, supporting both native SCION hosts and IP hosts.\r\n \r\n ## Autonomous System Deployment\r\n A SCION AS needs to deploy the SCION [infrastructure components](#infra-components) and border routers. Practice shows that all of them can be deployed on standard x86 commercial off-the-shelf servers, supporting up to 100 Gbps links. With a P4 implementation hardware it is possible to forward SCION traffic even at terabit speeds {{DERUITER2021}}.\r\n-Within an AS, SCION is deployed as an IP overlay on top of the existing network. This way SCION allows, by design, to reuse the existing intra-domain network and equipment (i.e., IP, MPLS, ...). Customer-side SCION border routers directly connect to the provider-side border routers using last-mile connections. The SCION design assumes that AS\u2019s internal entities are considered to be trustworthy, therefore the IP overlay or the first-hop routing does not compromise or degrade any security properties SCION delivers.\r\n+Within an AS, SCION is deployed as an IP overlay on top of the existing network.

The SCION design assumes that AS\u2019s internal entities are considered to be trustworthy, therefore the IP overlay or the first-hop routing does not compromise or degrade any security properties SCION delivers.\r\n When it comes to inter-domain communication, an overlay deployment on top of today\u2019s Internet is not desirable, as SCION would inherit issues from  its weak underlay. Thus, intra-AS SCION links are usually deployed in parallel to existing links, in order to preserve its security properties. That is, two SCION border routers are directly connected via a layer-2 cross-connection at a common point-of-presence, achieving connectivity with high reliability, availability, and performance.\r\n \r\n TODO: sentences mentioning throughput seem a bit out of the blue here...

Also,\r\n ## Internet Exchange Points\r\n Internet Exchange Points (IXP) play an important role for SCION as they do in today\u2019s Internet.  SCION can be deployed at existing IXPs following a \"big switch\" model, where the IXP provides a large L2 switch between multiple SCION ASes. SCION has been deployed following this model at the Swiss Internet Exchange (SwissIX),  currently interconnecting major SCION Swiss ISPs and enterprises through bi-lateral peering over a dedicated SCION port.\r\n \r\n-Additionally, thanks to its path-awareness, SCION offers the option of an enhanced deployment model. The internal topology of an IXP to be exposed within the SCION control plane. This enables IXP customers to use SCION\u2019s multi-path and fast failover capabilities to leverage the IXP\u2019s internal links (including backup links) and to select paths depending on the application\u2019s needs.  IXPs have therefore an incentive to expose their rich internal connectivity as the benefits from SCION\u2019s multi-path capabilities would increase their value for customers and provide them with a competitive advantage.\r\n+Additionally, thanks to its path-awareness, SCION offers the option of an enhanced deployment model, i.e. to expose the internal topology of an IXP within the SCION control plane.

The benefit of using SCION natively is that the full range of advantages becomes available to applications, at the cost of installing the SCION endpoint stack and making the application SCION-aware. In the short term, the second approach is preferred.\r\n@@ -609,9 +609,9 @@ In order to allow incremental deployability and to ease transition from legacy I\r\n \r\n SCION has been deployed in production by multiple entities, growing its acceptance among industry.

These topics, which are equally important for the Internet to perform well, lie outside the scope of SCION.\n> ```\n\nWhat do you mean?
