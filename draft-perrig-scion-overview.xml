    <abstract>


<t>The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic expectations and is intertwined with many aspects of our society. Unfortunately, the security of today’s Internet is far from commensurate with its importance as critical infrastructure. Additionally, the Internet has not primarily been built for high availability in the presence of adversaries, and recent proposals to improve Internet security and availability have been constrained by the setup of the current architecture.</t>

<t>The next-generation inter-network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) aims to address the above-mentioned issues. SCION was explicitly designed from the outset to offer availability and security by default. The architecture provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communication. It also enables multi-path routing between hosts.</t>

<t>This document discusses the motivations behind the SCION architecture and gives a high-level overview of its fundamental components, including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and data plane. As SCION is already in production use today, the document concludes with an overview of SCION deployments.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>The Internet has been incredibly successful as it grew to a planet-scale network with billions of devices. But although this world-wide communication system guarantees global reachability, it falls short of providing other properties that are in demand today. These shortcomings of the current Internet are the reason for developing SCION: To make the Internet more secure, reliable, transparent, and scalable.</t>

<t>The Introduction section explores the motivation to develop SCION, followed by a short description of SCION's main elements. The sections after the Introduction provide deeper insight into SCION's key concepts and features. The document concludes with some concrete case studies where SCION has been applied successfully.</t>

<section anchor="why"><name>Why SCION - Motivation</name>

<t>Since its introduction back in the 1980s (1970s?), the Internet has never stopped to expand. As a consequence, the global network continually needs to accommodate new uses. This has brought many issues to light, including a lack of transparency and control, poor scalability, occurrences of severe outages, weak fault isolation, and (stateful) routing that becomes increasingly time- and energy-consuming. As the Internet has not been built with security in mind, the lack thereof is another major problem. Because of this, the current Internet offers little protection against attacks such as spoofing, prefix- and DNS-hijacking, denial-of-service, and combinations of these. For more background information, see <xref target="SCHUCHARD2011"/>, <xref target="LABOVITZ2000"/>, <xref target="GRIFFIN1999"/>, <xref target="SAHOO2009"/>, and <xref target="RFC4264"/>.</t>

<t>Up until now, there have been numerous initiatives to address the above issues (e.g., <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC6480"/>, <xref target="RFC8205"/>, and <xref target="RFC8446"/>). Although these initiatives have brought many improvements, concerns regarding security and scalability still remain (see, for example, <xref target="LYCHEV2013"/>, <xref target="LI2014"/>, <xref target="COOPER2013"/>, <xref target="ROTHENBERGER2017"/>, and <xref target="MORILLO2021"/>). Also other requirements that users have of today's Internet are not fulfilled yet (see, among others, <eref target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-king-irtf-challenges-in-routing/">draft-king-irtf-challenges-in-routing</eref>. This especially pertains to the demands of organizational users that exchange sensitive information and/or operate internationally, such as banks, insurances, health institutions, universities, governments, and all big international companies and NGOs.</t>

<t>These users require the Internet to be highly available at all times and constantly perform on a high level. They expect reliable operation of the global network also in case of failures, by the use of multi-path routing. They want to send their vulnerable data packets over the most secure and trustworthy networking routes, and therefore prefer to select themselves the path their data will take. They also need to be sure with whom they communicate over the net and must be able to trust the content of the messages. And they want to be protected against all kinds of attacks. In short, today's users of the Internet seek performance, control, reliability, and security.</t>

<t>SCION has been developed in order to meet the above-mentioned requirements. SCION aims to reach the following goals:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Address the Internet's fundamental issues by offering
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>high availability also in the presence of adversaries,</t>
      <t>fast failover in the case of faulty connections, and</t>
      <t>prevention from hijacking, DoS, and other attacks.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Make the Internet more transparent and efficient.</t>
  <t>Improve the Internet's scalability.</t>
  <t>Prepare the Internet for tomorrow's applications, such as virtual reality, Internet of Things (IoT), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="avoiding-pitfalls"><name>Avoiding Pitfalls</name>

<t>Of course SCION is not the first concept that addresses the Internet's networking issues. But unfortunately many other promising solutions for the Internet's problems have never managed to succeed, for reasons described in <xref target="RFC9049"/>. SCION, however, seems to successfully avoid the pitfalls mentioned in this document. For example, SCION does not have to be implemented by the entire Internet to be effective: The routing architecture provides benefits already to early adapters. Even if only a small part of the global network works with SCION, adapters will still take advantage of using the SCION routing technology. Moreover, not only users of SCION profit from it, also ISPs and operators benefit from deploying SCION: Providers can charge the use of SCION, and users are willing to pay for it. Furthermore, SCION can be installed on top of and function alongside the existing routing infrastructure and protocols--there is no need for bigger changes in an operational network.<br />
The above points facilitate the deployment of SCION and increase its acceptance. The several cases where SCION is already successfully implemented today illustrate this (see the section <xref target="deploy">Deployments</xref>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="formal-verification"><name>Formal Verification</name>

<t>An additional feature of SCION is its formal verification. The SCION network system consists of a variety of different components such as routers, servers, and edge devices. Such a complex system eludes the mental capacities of human beings for considering all possible states and interactions. That is why SCION has been formally verified by the Department of Computer Science of the ETH Zurich. This guarantees that SCION's code is correct and consistent, does not include any overlooked errors, and will function without faults.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="scion-overview"><name>SCION Overview</name>

<t>SCION has been designed to address the security issues of today's Internet depicted in the previous section <xref target="why">Why SCION - Motivation</xref>. This section gives a high-level description of SCION's main elements, providing a basic understanding of this next-generation inter-network architecture.</t>

<section anchor="network-architecture-and-naming"><name>Network Architecture and Naming</name>

<t>SCION's main goal is to offer highly available and efficient inter-domain packet delivery—even in the presence of actively malicious entities. To achieve scalability and sovereignty, SCION organizes existing ASes into groups of independent routing planes, called <strong>Isolation Domains (ISD)</strong>. An AS can be a member of multiple ISDs. All ASes in an ISD agree on a set of trust roots, called the <strong>Trust Root Configuration (TRC)</strong>, ensuring that network traffic only flows on policy-compliant paths. The ISD is governed by a set of <strong>core ASes</strong>, which provide connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust roots. Typically, the 3–10 largest ASes of an ISD form the ISD’s core.</t>

<t>Isolation domains serve the following purposes:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>They allow SCION to support trust heterogeneity, as each ISD can independently define its roots of trust;</t>
  <t>They provide transparency for trust relationships;</t>
  <t>They isolate the routing process within an ISD from external influences such as attacks and misconfigurations; and</t>
  <t>They improve the scalability of the routing protocol by separating it into a process within and one between ISDs.</t>
</list></t>

<t>ISDs provide natural isolation of routing failures and misconfigurations, give endpoints strong control over both inbound and outbound traffic, provide meaningful and enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates with high path-freshness.</t>

<t><strong>Links</strong>
There are three types of links in SCION: core links, parent-child links, and peering links.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A <strong>core link</strong> can only exist between two core ASes.</t>
  <t>A <strong>parent-child link</strong> requires that at least one of the two connected ASes is a non-core AS. ASes with a parent-child link usually belong to the same entity or have a provider-customer relationship.</t>
  <t>A <strong>peering link</strong> also includes at least non-core AS. A peering link exists between ASes with a (standard or paid) relationship.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="routing"><name>Routing</name>

<t>SCION operates on two routing levels: intra-ISD and inter-ISD. As a path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available network path segments through <strong>path-segment construction beacons (PCBs)</strong>. A PCB is initiated by a core AS and then disseminated either within an ISD (to explore intra-ISD paths) or among core ASes (to explore core paths across different ISDs). The PCBs accumulate cryptographically protected path- and forwarding information on AS-level, and store this information in the form of <strong>hop fields (HFs)</strong>. End hosts use the information from these PCBs/hop fields to create end-to-end forwarding paths for data packets, who carry this information in their packet headers. This concept is called <strong>packet-carried forwarding state (PCFS)</strong>. The concept also supports multi-path communication among end hosts.</t>

<t>The process of creating an end-to-end forwarding path consists of the following steps:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>First, an AS discovers paths to other ASes, during the <em>path exploration</em> (or beaconing) phase.</t>
  <t>The AS then selects a few PCBs according to defined policies, transforms the selected PCBs into path segments, and registers these segments with a path infrastructure, thus making them available to other ASes. This happens during the <em>path registration</em> phase.</t>
  <t>During the <em>path resolution</em> phase, the actual creation of an end-to-end forwarding path to the destination takes place. For this, an end host performs
   a. a <em>path lookup</em> step, to obtain path segments, and
   b. a <em>path combination</em> step, to combine the forwarding path from the segments.</t>
</list></t>

<t><strong>ISD and AS numbering</strong>
SCION decouples end-host addressing from inter-domain routing. Routing is based on the &lt;ISD, AS&gt; tuple, agnostic of end-host addressing. Existing AS numbers are inherited from the current Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for additional SCION AS numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today. The end host local address is not used for inter-domain routing or forwarding, does not need to be globally unique, and can thus be an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example. A SCION address is therefore composed of the &lt;ISD, AS, local address&gt; 3-tuple.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-components"><name> Infrastructure Components</name>

<t>The <strong>beacon service</strong>, the <strong>path service</strong>, and the <strong>certificate service</strong> are the main infrastructure components within a SCION AS. Each service can be deployed redundantly, depending on the AS's size and type. It is also possible to combine the services into one or more <em>control services</em>. <em>Internal routers</em> forward packets inside the AS, while <em>border routers</em> provide interconnectivity between ASes.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The beacon service discovers path information. It is responsible for generating, receiving, and propagating PCBs. Periodically, the beacon service generates a set of PCBs, which are forwarded to its child ASes or neighboring core ASes. The PCBs are flooded over policy-compliant paths to discover multiple paths between any pair of core ASes.</t>
  <t>The path service stores mappings from AS identifiers to sets of announced path segments. The path service is organized as a hierarchical caching system similar to that of DNS. Through the beacon service, ASes select the set of path segments through which they want to be reached, and they register them to the path service in the ISD core.</t>
  <t>The certificate service keeps cached copies of certificates and manages keys and certificates for securing inter-AS communication. The certificate service is queried by the beacon service when validating the authenticity of PCBs (i.e., when the beacon service lacks a certificate).</t>
</list></t>

<t><em>Border routers</em> are deployed at the edge of SCION ASes. The main task of border routers is to forward packets to a neighbor border router or the destination host within the AS. While SCION takes care of intra-domain routing, it relies on existing routing protocols (e.g., IS-IS, OSPF, SDN) and communication fabric (e.g., IP, MPLS) for intra-domain forwarding.  <em>Internal routers</em>, therefore, do not need to be changed to support SCION.</t>

<section anchor="key-concepts"><name>Key Concepts</name>

<section anchor="authentication"><name>Authentication</name>

<t>SCION’s control plane relies on a public-key infrastructure we call the <strong>control-plane PKI (CP-PKI)</strong>, in which each ISD defines its own roots of trust and policies in a file called trust root configuration (TRC). A TRC is a signed collection of certificates, which also contains ISD-specific policies, for example, specifying how many signatures an updated TRC should contain to be valid.
Each SCION AS must hold a private key (to sign PCBs) and a certificate attesting that it is the rightful owner of the corresponding public key. One of the main roles of the TRC is thus enabling the verification of <strong>AS certificates</strong> and PCBs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="control-plane"><name>Control Plane</name>

<t>The SCION control plane discovers and distributes AS-level path segments. A path segment encodes a network path at the granularity
of inter-domain interfaces on either end of an inter-domain link connecting two consecutive ASes on a path.
<!-- Constructing inter-domain paths at the granularity of inter-AS links increases the number of available paths and enables optimization of paths with regard to different criteria. --></t>

<t>Each end-to-end path consists of up to three path segments: core path, up-path, and down-path segments. Core-path segments
refer to path segments containing only core ASes, an up-path segment is a path segment from a customer (leaf AS) to a provider
(core AS) inside one ISD, and a down-path segment is a path segment from a provider (core AS) to a customer (leaf AS) inside
an ISD.</t>

<t>To address the sub-optimality of hierarchical routing, SCION introduces peering links and shortcuts. In a shortcut, a path only contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at a non-core AS that is common to both paths. Peering links can be added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar to today’s Internet.</t>

<t>Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and down-path segments. The path segment construction process is referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path segments. Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by reversing the order of ASes in a segment. The beaconing process in each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks.</t>

<t>Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between core ASes. During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other neighboring core ASes.</t>

<t>Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy, which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes. For this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors (typically customer ASes). Each non-core AS propagates the received PCBs to its respective customers. This procedure continues until the PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD. Non-core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the same peering link.</t>

<t>A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path segments. Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control service. The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where information is fetched on-demand only. A core AS’s path server stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="data-plane"><name>Data Plane</name>

<t>Name resolution in SCION returns the &lt;ISD, AS, local address&gt; 3-tuple. Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the &lt;ISD, AS&gt; tuple. Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with the received core- and down-path segments.</t>

<t>Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment. Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent unauthorized path combinations.</t>

<t>The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS. The hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path alteration. This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS) replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need any local state on either paths or flows.</t>
