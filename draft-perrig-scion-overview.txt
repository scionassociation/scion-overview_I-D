Abstract

   The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic
   expectations and is intertwined with many aspects of our society.
   Unfortunately, the security of today's Internet is far from
   commensurate with its importance as critical infrastructure.
   Additionally, the Internet has not primarily been built for high
   availability in the presence of malicious actors, and recent
   proposals to improve Internet security and availability have been
   constrained by the setup of the current architecture.

   The next-generation inter-network architecture SCION (Scalability,
   Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) aims to address
   the above-mentioned issues.  SCION was explicitly designed from the
   outset to offer availability and security by default.  The
   architecture provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit
   trust information for end-to-end communication.  It also enables
   multi-path routing between hosts.

   This document gives a high-level overview of the SCION architecture,
   including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and
   data plane.  As SCION is already in production use today, we conclude
   with an overview of SCION deployments.

1.  Introduction

   The Introduction section explains why we designed SCION in the first
   place.  It presents an overview of the current Internet's most
   salient problems and shortcomings, which together are the reason for
   developing SCION: To address these issues in order to make the
   Internet more secure, reliable, transparent, and efficient.

   The sections after the Introduction provide further insight into
   SCION's main concepts and features.  We complete the document with
   some concrete case studies where SCION has been applied successfully.

1.1.  Why SCION - Internet's Issues

   Two protocols effectively define today's Internet architecture: the
   Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC8200], [RFC0791] and the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271].  These protocols have remained virtually
   unchanged since the standardization of IPv6 [RFC2460] and BGP-4
   [RFC1653] in the 1990s.  However, as the Internet continued to expand
   and needed to accommodate new uses, numerous issues came to light.
   The following sections describe these issues in more detail.

1.1.1.  Internet Protocol

   IP is one of the fundamental protocols of the Internet, as it enables
   the forwarding of packets between end hosts.  Its first major
   version, IPv4, was specified in 1981 [RFC0791] and its (non-backward
   compatible) successor, IPv6, was introduced in 1998 [RFC2460].  After
   this, no major changes have taken place.  The IP protocol follows a
   relatively simple approach: End hosts do not need to know the
   complete path to forward packets, nor can they influence the path the
   packets take.  But this approach comes with several drawbacks:

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  *Lack of transparency and control*
      Being able to select and verify the path that packets take is
      desirable in many situations.  End hosts might want to avoid
      packets being routed through adversarial or untrusted networks, or
      they might want to choose the most suitable path with regard to a
      specific metric (e.g., latency or bandwidth).  Unfortunately, IP
      does not offer such an option.  Although systems that enable loose
      and strict source routing have been proposed, these extensions are
      not commonly supported in today's networks.  It is also not
      possible to simultaneously use multiple distinct paths towards the
      same destination.

   *  *Stateful routers*
      IP routers maintain forwarding tables to determine the next hop of
      a received packet.  This basic requirement has undesirable
      consequences.  Performing a forwarding-table lookup for every
      packet is a time-consuming operation.  Therefore, high-performance
      networking equipment typically relies on ternary content-
      addressable memory (TCAM) hardware, which is expensive and energy-
      intensive.  Moreover, the constantly growing size of forwarding
      tables, partially due to the slow but steady deployment of IPv6,
      poses a problem for routers, as the storage capacity of TCAM
      hardware is limited.  Routers that keep state for network
      information can also suffer from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
      exhausting the router's state [SCHUCHARD2011].

1.1.2.  BGP

   BGP is the routing protocol that provides connectivity between
   autonomous systems (ASes), such as Internet service providers (ISPs).
   The protocol enables ISPs to perform traffic engineering and select
   routes based on policies that reflect the ISPs' business
   relationships.  However, BGP suffers from a number of shortcomings:

   *  *Outages*
      Since the control plane and the data plane are not clearly
      separated in today's Internet, forwarding may suddenly fail during
      route changes.  By attacking routing, an adversary can thus
      interfere with packet forwarding.  Furthermore, when BGP update
      messages are sent, the network may require up to tens of minutes
      to converge to a stable state [LABOVITZ2000], which can lead to
      intermittent outages.  As an indicator of these problems, a study
      has shown that a sudden degradation in user-perceived quality of
      voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls is highly correlated with BGP updates
      [KUSHMAN2007].

   *  *Lack of fault isolation*
      BGP is a globally distributed protocol, running among all BGP
      speakers in the entire Internet.  BGP update messages are thus
      disseminated globally.  Due to the lack of any routing hierarchy
      or isolation between different areas, a single faulty BGP speaker
      can affect routing in the entire world.

   *  *Poor scalability*
      The amount of work required to be performed by BGP is proportional
      to the number of destinations.  Moreover, path changes are
      disseminated profusely and sometimes throughout the entire
      Internet.  This reduces scalability and prevents BGPsec from
      frequently disseminating freshly signed routing updates.

   *  *Convergence*
      ASes must have a consistent view of the network topology and agree
      on the set of paths to use for packet forwarding.  Otherwise,
      forwarding loops may occur.  Unfortunately, convergence to a
      consistent and stable state depends on the policies of individual
      ASes.  In certain situations, BGP will never converge to a stable
      state [GRIFFIN1999].  Other topologies cause BGP wedgies, where
      BGP converges but non-deterministically [RFC4264].  In general,
      BGP convergence after topology changes can require several
      minutes, during which users may experience outages [SAHOO2009].
      In addition, BGP convergence constitutes an attack vector for
      malicious actors and makes verifying security and availability
      properties highly challenging.

   *  *Single path*
      BGP only allows the selection of a single path to a destination.
      Although some multipath protocols support simultaneous use of
      multiple network interfaces, BGP does not provide path control to
      end hosts and does not allow use of multiple AS-level paths.  This
      can even lead to outages when BGP selects a legitimate but
      inefficient route through a link that is too small to satisfy the
      demand (bottleneck routing).  In such a situation, end hosts have
      no choice but to wait until ASes in the Internet manually modify
      policies such that a more appropriate path is chosen.

   *  *Lack of security*
      BGP has no built-in security mechanisms and does not provide any
      tools for ASes to authenticate the information they receive
      through BGP update messages.  This opens up a multitude of attack
      opportunities--see also Attacks (Section 1.1.4.2).  RPKI and
      BGPsec tried to addressed these security issues in recent years.
      However, RPKI and BGPsec have problems of their own, as we discuss
      in the next section.

1.1.3.  RPKI and BGPsec

   Researchers already started working on improving the Internet's
   security in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  While change was very
   slow initially (RPKI [RFC6480] and BGPsec [RFC8205] were only
   standardized in 2012 and 2017, respectively), there has been a
   substantial increase in RPKI deployment in recent years.
   But RPKI and BGPsec have issues of their own, which we discuss in the
   following sections.  These issues made us believe that a more radical
   change to today's Internet architecture is necessary to fundamentally
   resolve its (security) problems.

1.1.3.1.  RPKI and Route Origin Authorizations

   RPKI provides certificates to ASes, and certificates for the IP
   addresses they own, which are called Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs).  Unfortunately, ROAs only prevent the simplest form of BGP
   hijacks, see Attacks (Section 1.1.4.2).

1.1.3.2.  Problems with BGPsec in Partial Deployment

   BGPsec was standardized not before 2017, and it will likely take many
   years until it reaches global deployment.  However, the protocol
   provides very little security benefits unless it is consistently used
   and enforced by all ASes, see [LYCHEV2013].  In a partial deployment,
   BGPsec can even cause instabilities and is prone to downgrade
   attacks.

1.1.3.3.  Problems with BGPsec in Full Deployment

   Even if all ASes in the world were to deploy BGPsec, many issues
   remain, such as the creation of wormholes and forwarding loops by
   attackers, or the introduction of circular dependencies, see [LI2014]
   and [COOPER2013], respectively.
   RPKI and BGPsec also cause issues for network sovereignty
   [ROTHENBERGER2017].  As very few organizations are at the root of the
   RPKI hierarchy, these organizations have control over the creation or
   revocation of certificates.  Depending on the jurisdiction, local
   courts of some countries may gain the power to shut down parts of the
   Internet, which makes some ISPs reluctant to deploy RPKI.
   Additionally, BGPsec further exacerbates BGP's scalability issues.
   To provide global connectivity, every one of the currently about
   75,000 ASes in the world needs to know how to reach every other AS.
   This requires a large number of BGP update messages, the processing
   of which requires many more resources in BGPsec due to the additional
   cryptographic operations.
   Furthermore, prefix aggregation no longer works in BGPsec because the
   digital signatures are not aggregated.  This is particularly

   cumbersome, as Internet routers need to store and exchange a fast-
   growing number of paths (caused by the increasing fragmentation of
   the IP address space and the trend towards announcing ever smaller IP
   address ranges).

1.1.4.  Other Internet Issues

1.1.4.1.  Lack of Authentication

   Authenticating digital data is becoming increasingly important, as
   adversaries exploit the absence of authentication to inject malicious
   information.  To address these issues, infrastructures to provide
   authentication, such as RPKI/BGPsec, TLS [RFC8446], and DNSSEC
   [RFC4033], have been added in an ad-hoc manner.
   Unfortunately, these protocols are sensitive to the compromise of a
   single entity.  DNSSEC and RPKI rely on a single or very small number
   of roots of trust, whereas TLS is based on an oligopolistic trust
   model, in which any one of hundreds of authorities can issue a
   certificate for any domain name.  The Internet Control Message
   Protocol (ICMP) does not even have an authenticated counterpart, thus
   allowing the injection of fake ICMP packets, see [RFC4443] and
   [RFC0791].
   The Internet also does not support the establishment of a shared
   secret key between two end hosts for encrypted and authenticated end-
   to-end communication; the simplest mechanism today is to rely on
   trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approaches.  They opportunistically send
   the public key unauthenticated to the other communicating party.

1.1.4.2.   Attacks

   The current Internet architecture offers little to no protection
   against several attacks, such as prefix hijacking, spoofing, denial
   of service, DNS hijacking, and composed versions thereof (which use a
   combination of vulnerabilities, or use a vulnerability in one
   protocol to compromise another protocol).

   *  *Prefix hijacking*
      Due to a lack of authentication and fault isolation in BGP,
      numerous Internet outages are caused by prefix hijacking.  Prefix
      hijacking can also be used for interception (142).  This problem
      is exacerbated by the fact that defining BGP routing policies is
      often a complicated, manual, and thus error-prone process.
      Unfortunately, BGP hijacks are still possible when RPKI is
      deployed and are only resolved in a full deployment of BGPsec:
      With RPKI, a malicious AS trying to hijack a particular IP prefix
      can still send a BGP update message claiming that it is directly
      connected to its legitimate owner (for which there exists a valid
      ROA).  Recipients of such an announcement would accept it, since



Perrig                   Expires 8 October 2022                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


      the legitimate owner of the addresses is noted as the last AS in
      the BGP message.  They would then start sending traffic intended
      for those IP addresses to the attacker, who can inspect, reroute,
      or drop it.
      Also, in settings where route origin validation (ROV) is deployed,
      Morillo et al. recently point out several new attacks: hidden
      hijack, non-routed prefix hijack, and super-prefix hijack of non-
      routed prefixes [MORILLO2021].

   *  *Spoofing and DDoS attacks*
      ICMP can be employed to send error or diagnostic messages (used by
      tools such as ping or traceroute).  Because ICMP packets are not
      authenticated, the source address can easily be spoofed.  This can
      lead to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks [KUMAR2007],
      or be used to disconnect two BGP routers from each other
      [RFC5927].  Since regular IP packets are not authenticated either,
      they suffer from the same problem, i.e., the source IP address can
      be spoofed.

   *  *Deceiving Certification Authorities with BGP*
      Certification authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates used to
      protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks.  Ironically,
      CAs themselves are vulnerable to attacks, as they rely on
      exchanging unencrypted and unauthenticated packets during domain
      validation.  If attackers manage to redirect these packets, they
      can obtain fraudulent certificates.  This may happen, for example,
      if an attacker has access to an AS's border router and is thus
      able to launch a prefix-hijacking attack.  One of the
      countermeasures proposed by Birge-Lee et al. is to perform domain
      validation from multiple vantage points.  See also Proceedings
      USENIX 2018
      (https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/
      birge-lee) and Proceedings USENIX 2021
      (https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/
      birge-lee), respectively.  Unfortunately, this does not fully
      solve the problem, as it only protects CAs from attackers who
      control a limited number of border routers.

   *  *DNS Hijacking and Cross-layer Attacks*
      Over the past few years, researchers have discovered a flurry of
      subtle vulnerabilities that can poison DNS caches or hijack name
      servers.  Alarmingly, DNS hijacking has been widely observed in
      the wild, too, as evidenced by large-scale hijacking campaigns
      such as Sea Turtle.
      Because of its essential functionality, DNS also plays a central
      role in broader contexts of Internet security.  A recent
      measurement research shows that DNS vulnerabilities can be
      leveraged to subvert a range of Internet systems and services

      including but not limited to PKIs, time synchronization, email,
      VPN, and web applications.  A secure DNS is thus indispensable to
      a secure Internet.  Unfortunately, DNSSEC as the standardized
      solution has not achieved widespread deployment, in part also
      because it introduces numerous additional limitations (see the
      SCION book 2).
      For more information, see [MAN2020], [ZHENG2020],
      [ALOWAISHEQ2020], [HOUSER2021], 7, and [DAI2021], respectively.

1.2.  Goals for a Secure Internet Architecture

   We are convinced that a real change to today's Internet architecture
   is necessary to fundamentally resolve its problems.  In this section,
   we present high-level goals that such a next-generation inter-domain,
   point-to-point, communication architecture should achieve.  We
   believe that SCION meets these goals.

1.2.1.  Availability in the Presence of Adversaries

   Our overarching goal is the design of a communication infrastructure
   that remains highly available even in the presence of distributed
   adversaries: As long as an attacker-free path between end hosts
   exists, that path should be discovered and provide some guaranteed
   amount of bandwidth between these end hosts.

1.2.2.   Transparency and Control

   We seek to achieve greater transparency and control for the
   forwarding paths of network packets, and the trust roots used for
   authentication.  When the network offers path transparency, end hosts
   can predict (and verify) the forwarding path taken by packets.
   Taking transparency of network paths as a first property, we aim to
   additionally achieve path control, a stronger property that (1)
   enables ASes to control the incoming path segments through which they
   are reachable and (2) allows senders to then create and select end-
   to-end paths.

   This requirement has not only beneficial repercussions, but also
   fragile if implemented incorrectly.  We will discuss both.

   The beneficial aspects of path control are:

   *  _Separation of control plane and data plane_: To enable path
      control, the control plane (which determines networking paths)
      must be separated from the data plane (which forwards packets
      according to the determined paths).  The separation ensures that
      forwarding cannot retroactively be influenced by control-plane
      operations, e.g., routing changes.  The separation contributes to
      enhanced availability.

   *  _Multipath communication_: Path control lets any sender select
      multiple paths to carry packets towards the destination.
      Multipath communication is a powerful mechanism to enhance
      availability [ANDERSEN2001] and enables fast failover, where end
      hosts can immediately switch to a backup path in the event that a
      link on their currently used path fails.

   *  _Geofencing_: Applications that transmit sensitive data can
      benefit from path control by ensuring that packets only traverse
      certain trusted ASes and avoid others.  This is important for
      certain industries, like the financial sector or healthcare.

   *  _Defending against network attacks_: If the packet's path is
      carried in its header (which is one way to achieve path control),
      then the destination can reverse the path to return its response
      to the sender, mitigating reflection attacks.  Path control also
      enables circumvention of malicious network entities or congested
      network areas, providing a powerful mechanism against DoS and DDoS
      attacks.

   The fragile aspects that need to be handled with care are the
   following:

   *  _Respecting the forwarding policies of ISPs_: If senders have
      complete path control, they may violate ISPs' forwarding policies.
      We thus need to ensure that ISPs offer a set of policy-compliant
      paths which senders can choose from.

   *  _Preventing malicious path creation_: A malicious sender could
      exploit path control for attacks, for example by forming malicious
      forwarding paths such as loops that consume increased network
      resources.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  _Scalability of path control_: Pure source routing does not scale
      to inter-domain networks, as a source would need to know the full
      network topology to determine paths.  With SCION, a source does
      not compute an end-to-end path based on a topology, but selects
      among a set of paths provided by the control plane.  We call this
      path control.  To make path control scale, we thus rely on source-
      selected paths and packet-carried forwarding state instead of on
      full-fledged source routing.

   *  _Permitting traffic engineering_: Fine-grained path control would
      inhibit ISPs from operating and performing traffic engineering.
      We thus seek to provide end-host path control at the granularity
      of links between ASes, allowing ISPs to fully control internal
      paths.  ISPs can further perform traffic engineering based on per-
      path bandwidth allocations, which can be encoded in the forwarding
      information, or dynamically adjusted in the network.

   *  _Network stability_: Past research has shown that uncoordinated
      path selection by end hosts can lead to persistent oscillations,
      i.e., an alternating grow-and-shrink pattern of traffic volumes on
      links (188), [SHAIKH2001].  This is often raised as a key concern
      and represents one of the biggest obstacles to deploy path-aware
      networks [RFC9049].  It is thus imperative that a future Internet
      architecture take this into account and develop mechanisms
      preventing these instabilities [SCHERRER2020].

1.3.  SCION Network Structure and Naming

   SCION organizes existing ASes into groups of independent routing
   planes, called isolation domains (ISDs), which interconnect to
   provide global connectivity.  Isolation domains provide natural
   isolation of routing failures and misconfigurations, give endpoints
   strong control over both inbound and outbound traffic, provide
   meaningful and enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates
   with high path-freshness.

   As a path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available
   network path segments, and combine them into end-to-end paths that
   are carried in packet headers.  SCION also enables multi-path
   communication among end hosts.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   SCION reuses the Autonomous Systems (AS) structure, and ensures that
   network traffic only flows on policy-compliant paths.  To achieve
   scalability and sovereignty, Isolation Domains (ISD) are introduced.
   An ISD groups ASes that agree on a set of trust roots, called the
   Trust Root Configuration (TRC).  An AS can be a member of multiple
   ISDs.  The ISD is governed by a set of core ASes, which provide
   connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust roots.  Typically,
   the 3-10 largest ISPs of an ISD form the ISD's core.

   Routing is based on the <ISD, AS> tuple, agnostic of local
   addressing.  Existing AS numbers are inherited from the current
   Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for additional SCION AS
   numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today.  Host addressing
   extends the network address with a local address, forming the <ISD,
   AS, local address> 3-tuple.  The local address is not used in inter-
   domain routing or forwarding, does not need to be globally unique,
   and can thus be an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example.

   The SCION control plane discovers and distributes AS-level path
   segments.  A path segment encodes a network path at the granularity
   of inter-domain interfaces on either end of an inter-domain link
   connecting two consecutive ASes on a path.

   Each end-to-end path consists of up to three path segments: corepath,
   up-path, and down-path segments.  Core-path segments refer to path
   segments containing only core ASes, an up-path segment is a path
   segment from a customer (leaf AS) to a provider (core AS) inside one
   ISD, and a down-path segment is a path segment from a provider (core
   AS) to a customer (leaf AS) inside an ISD.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   To address the suboptimality of hierarchical routing, SCION
   introduces peering links and shortcuts.  In a shortcut, a path only
   contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at
   a non-core AS that is common to both paths.  Peering links can be
   added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar
   to today's Internet.

   Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on
   two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs
   core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and
   down-path segments.  The path segment construction process is
   referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon
   (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path
   segments.  Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by
   reversing the order of ASes in a segment.  The beaconing process in
   each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its
   Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks.

   Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between
   core ASes.  During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or
   propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other
   neighboring core ASes.

   Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy,
   which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes.  For
   this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors
   (typically customer ASes).  Each non-core AS propagates the received
   PCBs to its respective customers.  This procedure continues until the
   PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all
   ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD.  Non-
   core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling
   valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the
   same peering link.

   A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path
   segments.  Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control
   service.  The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where
   information is fetched on-demand only.  A core AS's path server
   stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf
   ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.

   Name resolution in SCION returns the <ISD, AS, local address>
   3-tuple.  Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the <ISD,
   AS> tuple.  Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with
   the received core- and down-path segments.

   Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and
   down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available
   between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment.
   Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent
   unauthorized path combinations.

   The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information
   about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS.  The
   hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path
   alteration.  This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS)
   replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need
   any local state on either paths or flows.
