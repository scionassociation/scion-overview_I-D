Abstract

   The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic
   expectations and is intertwined with many aspects of our society.
   Unfortunately, the security of today's Internet is not commensurate
   with its importance as critical infrastructure.  Additionally, the
   Internet has not primarily been built for high availability in the
   presence of malicious actors, and recent proposals to improve
   Internet security and availability have been constrained by the setup
   of the current architecture.

   The next-generation inter-network architecture SCION (Scalability,
   Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) aims to address
   the above-mentioned issues.  SCION was explicitly designed from the
   outset to offer availability and security by default.  The
   architecture provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit
   trust information for end-to-end communication.  It also enables
   multi-path routing between hosts.

   This document gives a high-level overview of the SCION architecture,
   including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and
   data plane.  As SCION is already in production use today, we conclude
   with an overview of SCION deployments.

1.  Introduction

   The Introduction section briefly presents the key concepts of the
   next-generation Internet architecture SCION.  We start this section
   with an explanation of why we designed SCION in the first place.

   The sections after the Introduction provide further insight into
   SCION's main concepts and features.  We complete the document with
   some concrete case studies where SCION has been applied successfully.

1.1.  Why SCION?

   Two protocols effectively define today's Internet architecture: the
   Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC8200], [RFC0791] and the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271].  These protocols have remained virtually
   unchanged since the standardization of IPv6 [RFC2460] and BGP-4
   [RFC1653] in the 1990s.  However, as the Internet continued to expand
   and needed to accommodate new uses, numerous issues came to light.
   This section presents a compact overview of the Internet's most
   salient problems and shortcomings, which together are the reason why
   we developed SCION: To address these issues in order to make the
   Internet more secure, reliable, transparent, and efficient.

1.1.1.  Internet Protocol

   IP is one of the fundamental protocols of the Internet, as it enables
   the forwarding of packets between end hosts.  Its first major
   version, IPv4, was specified in 1981 [RFC0791] and its (non-backward
   compatible) successor, IPv6, was introduced in 1998 [RFC2460].  After
   this, no major changes have taken place.  The IP protocol follows a
   relatively simple approach: End hosts do not need to know the
   complete path to forward packets, nor can they influence the path the
   packets take.  Unfortunately, this approach comes with many
   drawbacks:

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  *Lack of transparency and control*
      Being able to select and verify the path that packets take is
      desirable in many situations.  End hosts might want to avoid
      packets being routed through adversarial or untrusted networks, or
      they might want to choose the most suitable path with regard to a
      specific metric (e.g., latency or bandwidth).  Unfortunately, IP
      does not offer such an option.  Although systems that enable loose
      and strict source routing have been proposed, these extensions are
      not commonly supported in today's networks.  It is also not
      possible to simultaneously use multiple distinct paths towards the
      same destination.

   *  *Stateful routers*
      IP routers maintain forwarding tables to determine the next hop of
      a received packet.  This basic requirement has undesirable
      consequences.  Performing a forwarding-table lookup for every
      packet is a time-consuming operation.  Therefore, high-performance
      networking equipment typically relies on ternary content-
      addressable memory (TCAM) hardware, which is expensive and energy-
      intensive.  Moreover, the constantly growing size of forwarding
      tables, partially due to the slow but steady deployment of IPv6,
      poses a problem for routers, as the storage capacity of TCAM
      hardware is limited.  Routers that keep state for network
      information can also suffer from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
      exhausting the router's state [SCHUCHARD2011].

1.1.2.  BGP

   BGP is the routing protocol that provides connectivity between
   autonomous systems (ASes), such as Internet service providers (ISPs).
   The protocol enables ISPs to perform traffic engineering and select
   routes based on policies that reflect the ISPs' business
   relationships.  This happens through an intricate decision process
   that is used to select the best route to a destination [CAESAR2005].
   Unfortunately, BGP comes with a number of shortcomings:

   *  *Outages*
      Since the control plane and the data plane are not clearly
      separated in today's Internet, forwarding may suddenly fail during
      route changes.  By attacking routing, an adversary can thus
      interfere with packet forwarding.  Furthermore, when BGP update
      messages are sent, the network may require up to tens of minutes
      to converge to a stable state [LABOVITZ2000], which can lead to
      intermittent outages.  As an indicator of these problems, a study
      has shown, for example, that a sudden degradation in user-
      perceived quality of voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls is highly
      correlated with BGP updates [KUSHMAN2007].

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  *Lack of fault isolation*
      BGP is a globally distributed protocol, running among all BGP
      speakers in the entire Internet.  BGP update messages are thus
      disseminated globally.  Due to the lack of any routing hierarchy
      or isolation between different areas, a single faulty BGP speaker
      can affect routing in the entire world.

   *  *Poor scalability*
      The amount of work required to be performed by BGP is proportional
      to the number of destinations.  Moreover, path changes are
      disseminated profusely and sometimes throughout the entire
      Internet.  This reduces scalability and prevents BGPsec from
      frequently disseminating freshly signed routing updates.

   *  *Convergence*
      ASes must have a consistent view of the network topology and agree
      on the set of paths to use for packet forwarding.  Otherwise, AS A
      could configure AS B as the next hop for a particular destination,
      while B uses A as a next hop for the same destination.  In this
      case, a packet would be sent back and forth between the two ASes,
      which constitutes a forwarding loop.  Unfortunately, convergence
      to a consistent and stable state depends on the policies of
      individual ASes.  In certain situations, BGP will never converge
      to a stable state [GRIFFIN1999].  Other topologies cause BGP
      wedgies, where BGP converges but non-deterministically [RFC4264].
      In general, BGP convergence after topology changes can require
      several minutes, during which users may experience outages
      [SAHOO2009].  In addition, BGP convergence constitutes an attack
      vector for malicious actors and makes verifying security and
      availability properties highly challenging.

   *  *Single path*
      BGP only allows the selection of a single path to a destination.
      Although some multipath protocols support simultaneous use of
      multiple network interfaces, BGP does not provide path control to
      end hosts and does not allow use of multiple AS-level paths.  This
      can even lead to outages when BGP selects a legitimate but
      inefficient route through a link that is too small to satisfy the
      demand (bottleneck routing).  In such a situation, end hosts have
      no choice but to wait until ASes in the Internet manually modify
      policies such that a more appropriate path is chosen.

   *  *Lack of security*
      BGP has no built-in security mechanisms and does not provide any
      tools for ASes to authenticate the information they receive
      through BGP update messages.  This opens up a multitude of attack
      opportunities--see also Attacks (Section 1.1.5).  RPKI and BGPsec
      tried to addressed these security issues in recent years.
      However, RPKI and BGPsec have problems of their own, as we discuss
      in the next section.

1.1.3.  RPKI and BGPsec

   Researchers recognized the issues arising from the lack of security
   mechanisms in core Internet protocols, and started working on
   improvements already in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  While change
   was very slow initially (RPKI [RFC6480] and BGPsec [RFC8205] were
   only standardized in 2012 and 2017, respectively), there has been a
   substantial increase in RPKI deployment in recent years.  However,
   RPKI and BGPsec have issues of their own, which we will discuss in
   the following sections.  These issues made us believe that a more
   radical change to today's Internet architecture will be necessary to
   fundamentally resolve its security problems.

1.1.3.1.  RPKI and Route Origin Authorizations

   RPKI provides certificates to ASes, and certificates for the IP
   addresses they own, which are called Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs).  Unfortunately, ROAs only prevent the simplest form of BGP
   hijacks, see Attacks (Section 1.1.5).

1.1.3.2.  Problems with BGPsec in Partial Deployment

   BGPsec was standardized not before 2017, and it will likely take many
   years until it reaches global deployment.  However, the protocol
   provides very little security benefits unless it is consistently used
   and enforced by all ASes, see [LYCHEV2013].  In a partial deployment,
   BGPsec can even cause instabilities and is prone to downgrade
   attacks.

1.1.3.3.  Problems with BGPsec in Full Deployment

   Even if all ASes in the world were to deploy BGPsec, many issues
   remain, such as the creation of wormholes and forwarding loops by
   attackers, or the introduction of circular dependencies, see [LI2014]
   and [COOPER2013], respectively.  RPKI and BGPsec also cause issues
   for network sovereignty [ROTHENBERGER2017].  As very few
   organizations are at the root of the RPKI hierarchy, these
   organizations have the power to create or revoke certificates.
   Depending on the jurisdiction, local courts of some countries may

   gain the power to shut down parts of the Internet, which makes some
   ISPs reluctant to deploy RPKI.  Finally, BGPsec further exacerbates
   BGP's scalability issues.  To provide global connectivity, every one
   of the currently about 75,000 ASes in the world needs to know how to
   reach every other AS.  This requires a large number of BGP update
   messages, the processing of which requires many more resources in
   BGPsec due to the additional cryptographic operations.  Furthermore,
   prefix aggregation no longer works in BGPsec because the digital
   signatures are not aggregated.  This is particularly cumbersome, as
   Internet routers need to store and exchange a fast-growing number of
   paths, caused by the increasing fragmentation of the IP address space
   and the trend towards announcing ever smaller IP address ranges.

1.1.4.  Lack of Authentication

   The necessity of authenticating digital data is becoming increasingly
   prevalent, as adversaries exploit the absence of authentication to
   inject malicious information to attack the network.  Unfortunately,
   not only BGP but virtually all original protocols used in the
   Internet lack authentication features.  Infrastructures to provide
   authentication have been added in an ad hoc manner: RPKI provides the
   roots of trust for the authentication of BGPsec messages; TLS (433)
   allows browsers to authenticate web servers; and DNSSEC (33) provides
   authentication for DNS.  Nevertheless, the current situation is still
   unsatisfactory in many regards.  For example, all these protocols are
   sensitive to the compromise of a single entity.  DNSSEC and RPKI rely
   on a single or very small number of roots of trust, while TLS is
   based on an oligopolistic trust model in which any one of hundreds of
   authorities can issue a certificate for any domain name.  The
   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) (135)(417) does not even
   have an authenticated counterpart, thus allowing the injection of
   fake ICMP packets.  The Internet also lacks a general infrastructure
   to enable two end hosts to establish a shared secret key for end-to-
   end encrypted and authenticated communication; the simplest mechanism
   today is to rely on trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approaches (538), which
   opportunistically send the public key unauthenticated to the other
   communicating party.

1.2.  Key Concepts

1.2.1.  Network Structure and Naming

   SCION organizes existing ASes into groups of independent routing
   planes, called isolation domains (ISDs), which interconnect to
   provide global connectivity.  Isolation domains provide natural
   isolation of routing failures and misconfigurations, give endpoints
   strong control over both inbound and outbound traffic, provide
   meaningful and enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates
   with high path-freshness.

   As a path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available
   network path segments, and combine them into end-to-end paths that
   are carried in packet headers.  SCION also enables multi-path
   communication among end hosts.

   SCION reuses the Autonomous Systems (AS) structure, and ensures that
   network traffic only flows on policy-compliant paths.  To achieve
   scalability and sovereignty, Isolation Domains (ISD) are introduced.
   An ISD groups ASes that agree on a set of trust roots, called the
   Trust Root Configuration (TRC).  An AS can be a member of multiple
   ISDs.  The ISD is governed by a set of core ASes, which provide
   connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust roots.  Typically,
   the 3-10 largest ISPs of an ISD form the ISD's core.

   Routing is based on the <ISD, AS> tuple, agnostic of local
   addressing.  Existing AS numbers are inherited from the current
   Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for additional SCION AS
   numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today.  Host addressing
   extends the network address with a local address, forming the <ISD,
   AS, local address> 3-tuple.  The local address is not used in inter-
   domain routing or forwarding, does not need to be globally unique,
   and can thus be an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


1.2.3.  Control Plane

   The SCION control plane discovers and distributes AS-level path
   segments.  A path segment encodes a network path at the granularity
   of inter-domain interfaces on either end of an inter-domain link
   connecting two consecutive ASes on a path.

   Each end-to-end path consists of up to three path segments: corepath,
   up-path, and down-path segments.  Core-path segments refer to path
   segments containing only core ASes, an up-path segment is a path
   segment from a customer (leaf AS) to a provider (core AS) inside one
   ISD, and a down-path segment is a path segment from a provider (core
   AS) to a customer (leaf AS) inside an ISD.

   To address the suboptimality of hierarchical routing, SCION
   introduces peering links and shortcuts.  In a shortcut, a path only
   contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at
   a non-core AS that is common to both paths.  Peering links can be
   added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar
   to today's Internet.

   Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on
   two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs
   core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and
   down-path segments.  The path segment construction process is
   referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon
   (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path
   segments.  Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by
   reversing the order of ASes in a segment.  The beaconing process in
   each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its
   Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks.

   Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between
   core ASes.  During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or
   propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other
   neighboring core ASes.

   Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy,
   which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes.  For
   this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors
   (typically customer ASes).  Each non-core AS propagates the received
   PCBs to its respective customers.  This procedure continues until the
   PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all
   ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD.  Non-
   core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling
   valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the
   same peering link.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path
   segments.  Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control
   service.  The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where
   information is fetched on-demand only.  A core AS's path server
   stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf
   ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.

1.2.4.  Data Plane

   Name resolution in SCION returns the <ISD, AS, local address>
   3-tuple.  Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the <ISD,
   AS> tuple.  Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with
   the received core- and down-path segments.

   Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and
   down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available
   between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment.
   Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent
   unauthorized path combinations.

   The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information
   about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS.  The
   hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path
   alteration.  This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS)
   replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need
   any local state on either paths or flows.
