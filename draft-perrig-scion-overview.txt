Abstract

   SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation
   networks) is an inter-network architecture designed to provide route
   control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for end-
   to-end communication.

   SCION organizes existing ASes into groups of independent routing
   planes, called isolation domains, which interconnect to provide
   global connectivity.  Isolation domains provide natural isolation of
   routing failures and misconfigurations, give endpoints strong control
   for both inbound and outbound traffic, provide meaningful and
   enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates with high path
   freshness.

   As a path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available
   network path segments, and combine them into end-to-end paths that
   are carried in packet headers.  SCION also enables multi-path
   communication among end-hosts.

1.  Introduction

   SCION is a next-generation Internet architecture, offering high
   availability even in the presence of network adversaries.  In this
   Section, we briefly present the key concepts of the SCION
   architecture, including control- and data-plane features that are
   relevant to follow the paper.

1.1.  Network Structure and Naming

   SCION reuses the Autonomous Systems (AS) structure, and ensures that
   network traffic only flows on policy-compliant paths.  To achieve
   scalability and sovereignty, Isolation Domains (ISD) are introduced.
   An ISD groups ASes that agree on a set of trust roots, called the
   Trust Root Configuration (TRC).  An AS can be a member of multiple
   ISDs.  The ISD is governed by a set of core ASes, which provide
   connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust roots.  Typically,
   the 3-10 largest ISPs of an ISD form the ISD's core.

   Routing is based on the <ISD, AS> tuple, agnostic of local
   addressing.  Existing AS numbers are inherited from the current
   Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for additional SCION AS
   numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today.  Host addressing
   extends the network address with a local address, forming the <ISD,
   AS, local address> 3-tuple.  The local address is not used in inter-
   domain routing or forwarding, does not need to be globally unique,
   and can thus be an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example.

1.2.  Authentication

   Control-Plane PKI/TRC

1.3.  Control Plane

   The SCION control plane discovers and distributes AS-level path
   segments.  A path segment encodes a network path at the granularity
   of inter-domain interfaces on either end of an inter-domain link
   connecting two consecutive ASes on a path.

   Each end-to-end path consists of up to three path segments: corepath,
   up-path, and down-path segments.  Core-path segments refer to path
   segments containing only core ASes, an up-path segment is a path
   segment from a customer (leaf AS) to a provider (core AS) inside one
   ISD, and a down-path segment is a path segment from a provider (core
   AS) to a customer (leaf AS) inside an ISD.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     March 2022


   To address the suboptimality of hierarchical routing, SCION
   introduces peering links and shortcuts.  In a shortcut, a path only
   contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at
   a non-core AS that is common to both paths.  Peering links can be
   added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar
   to today's Internet.

   Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on
   two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs
   core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and
   down-path segments.  The path segment construction process is
   referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon
   (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path
   segments.  Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by
   reversing the order of ASes in a segment.  The beaconing process in
   each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its
   Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks.

   Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between
   core ASes.  During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or
   propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other
   neighboring core ASes.

   Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy,
   which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes.  For
   this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors
   (typically customer ASes).  Each non-core AS propagates the received
   PCBs to its respective customers.  This procedure continues until the
   PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all
   ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD.  Non-
   core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling
   valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the
   same peering link.

   A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path
   segments.  Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control
   service.  The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where
   information is fetched on-demand only.  A core AS's path server
   stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf
   ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.

1.4.  Data Plane

   Name resolution in SCION returns the <ISD, AS, local address>
   3-tuple.  Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the <ISD,
   AS> tuple.  Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with
   the received core- and down-path segments.

   Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and
   down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available
   between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment.
   Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent
   unauthorized path combinations.

   The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information
   about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS.  The
   hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path
   alteration.  This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS)
   replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need
   any local state on either paths or flows.
