Abstract

   The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic
   expectations and is intertwined with many aspects of our society.
   Unfortunately, the security of today's Internet is far from
   commensurate with its importance as critical infrastructure.
   Additionally, the Internet has not primarily been built for high
   availability in the presence of adversaries, and recent proposals to
   improve Internet security and availability have been constrained by
   the setup of the current architecture.

   The next-generation inter-network architecture SCION (Scalability,
   Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) aims to address
   the above-mentioned issues.  SCION was explicitly designed from the
   outset to offer availability and security by default.  The
   architecture provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit
   trust information for end-to-end communication.  It also enables
   multi-path routing between hosts.

   This document discusses the motivations behind the SCION architecture
   and gives a high-level overview of its fundamental components,
   including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and
   data plane.  As SCION is already in production use today, the
   document concludes with an overview of SCION deployments.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet has been incredibly successful as it grew to a planet-
   scale network with billions of devices.  But although this world-wide
   communication system guarantees global reachability, it falls short
   of providing other properties that are in demand today.  These
   shortcomings of the current Internet are the reason for developing
   SCION: To make the Internet more secure, reliable, transparent, and
   scalable.

   The Introduction section explores the motivation to develop SCION,
   followed by a short description of SCION's main elements.  The
   sections after the Introduction provide deeper insight into SCION's
   key concepts and features.  The document concludes with some concrete
   case studies where SCION has been applied successfully.

1.1.  Why SCION - Motivation

   Since its introduction back in the 1980s (1970s?), the Internet has
   never stopped to expand.  As a consequence, the global network
   continually needs to accommodate new uses.  This has brought many
   issues to light, including a lack of transparency and control, poor
   scalability, occurrences of severe outages, weak fault isolation, and
   (stateful) routing that becomes increasingly time- and energy-
   consuming.  As the Internet has not been built with security in mind,
   the lack thereof is another major problem.  Because of this, the
   current Internet offers little protection against attacks such as
   spoofing, prefix- and DNS-hijacking, denial-of-service, and
   combinations of these.  For more background information, see
   [SCHUCHARD2011], [LABOVITZ2000], [GRIFFIN1999], [SAHOO2009], and
   [RFC4264].

   Up until now, there have been numerous initiatives to address the
   above issues (e.g., [RFC4033], [RFC6480], [RFC8205], and [RFC8446]).
   Although these initiatives have brought many improvements, concerns
   regarding security and scalability still remain (see, for example,
   [LYCHEV2013], [LI2014], [COOPER2013], [ROTHENBERGER2017], and
   [MORILLO2021]).  Also other requirements that users have of today's

   Internet are not fulfilled yet (see, among others, draft-king-irtf-
   challenges-in-routing (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-king-
   irtf-challenges-in-routing/).  This especially pertains to the
   demands of organizational users that exchange sensitive information
   and/or operate internationally, such as banks, insurances, health
   institutions, universities, governments, and all big international
   companies and NGOs.

   These users require the Internet to be highly available at all times
   and constantly perform on a high level.  They expect reliable
   operation of the global network also in case of failures, by the use
   of multi-path routing.  They want to send their vulnerable data
   packets over the most secure and trustworthy networking routes, and
   therefore prefer to select themselves the path their data will take.
   They also need to be sure with whom they communicate over the net and
   must be able to trust the content of the messages.  And they want to
   be protected against all kinds of attacks.  In short, today's users
   of the Internet seek performance, control, reliability, and security.

   SCION has been developed in order to meet the above-mentioned
   requirements.  SCION aims to reach the following goals:

   *  Address the Internet's fundamental issues by offering

      -  high availability also in the presence of adversaries,

      -  fast failover in the case of faulty connections, and

      -  prevention from hijacking, DoS, and other attacks.

   *  Make the Internet more transparent and efficient.

   *  Improve the Internet's scalability.

   *  Prepare the Internet for tomorrow's applications, such as virtual
      reality, Internet of Things (IoT), and Distributed Ledger
      Technology (DLT).

1.1.1.  Avoiding Pitfalls

   Of course SCION is not the first concept that addresses the
   Internet's networking issues.  But unfortunately many other promising
   solutions for the Internet's problems have never managed to succeed,
   for reasons described in [RFC9049].  SCION, however, seems to
   successfully avoid the pitfalls mentioned in this document.  For
   example, SCION does not have to be implemented by the entire Internet
   to be effective: The routing architecture provides benefits already
   to early adapters.  Even if only a small part of the global network



de Kater & Perrig        Expires 30 October 2022                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   works with SCION, adapters will still take advantage of using the
   SCION routing technology.  Moreover, not only users of SCION profit
   from it, also ISPs and operators benefit from deploying SCION:
   Providers can charge the use of SCION, and users are willing to pay
   for it.  Furthermore, SCION can be installed on top of and function
   alongside the existing routing infrastructure and protocols--there is
   no need for bigger changes in an operational network.
   The above points facilitate the deployment of SCION and increase its
   acceptance.  The several cases where SCION is already successfully
   implemented today illustrate this (see the section Deployments
   (Section 3)).

1.1.2.  Formal Verification

   An additional feature of SCION is its formal verification.  The SCION
   network system consists of a variety of different components such as
   routers, servers, and edge devices.  Such a complex system eludes the
   mental capacities of human beings for considering all possible states
   and interactions.  That is why SCION has been formally verified by
   the Department of Computer Science of the ETH Zurich.  This
   guarantees that SCION's code is correct and consistent, does not
   include any overlooked errors, and will function without faults.

1.2.  SCION Overview

   SCION has been designed to address the security issues of today's
   Internet depicted in the previous section Why SCION - Motivation
   (Section 1.1).  This section gives a high-level description of
   SCION's main elements, providing a basic understanding of this next-
   generation inter-network architecture.

1.2.1.  Network Architecture and Naming

   SCION's main goal is to offer highly available and efficient inter-
   domain packet delivery--even in the presence of actively malicious
   entities.  To achieve scalability and sovereignty, SCION organizes
   existing ASes into groups of independent routing planes, called
   *Isolation Domains (ISD)*. An AS can be a member of multiple ISDs.
   All ASes in an ISD agree on a set of trust roots, called the *Trust
   Root Configuration (TRC)*, ensuring that network traffic only flows
   on policy-compliant paths.  The ISD is governed by a set of *core
   ASes*, which provide connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust
   roots.  Typically, the 3-10 largest ASes of an ISD form the ISD's
   core.

   Isolation domains serve the following purposes:





de Kater & Perrig        Expires 30 October 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  They allow SCION to support trust heterogeneity, as each ISD can
      independently define its roots of trust;

   *  They provide transparency for trust relationships;

   *  They isolate the routing process within an ISD from external
      influences such as attacks and misconfigurations; and

   *  They improve the scalability of the routing protocol by separating
      it into a process within and one between ISDs.

   ISDs provide natural isolation of routing failures and
   misconfigurations, give endpoints strong control over both inbound
   and outbound traffic, provide meaningful and enforceable trust, and
   enable scalable routing updates with high path-freshness.

   *Links* There are three types of links in SCION: core links, parent-
   child links, and peering links.

   *  A *core link* can only exist between two core ASes.

   *  A *parent-child link* requires that at least one of the two
      connected ASes is a non-core AS.  ASes with a parent-child link
      usually belong to the same entity or have a provider-customer
      relationship.

   *  A *peering link* also includes at least non-core AS.  A peering
      link exists between ASes with a (standard or paid) relationship.

   Figure 1 shows a high-level overview of the SCION network structure:

1.2.2.  Routing

   SCION operates on two routing levels: intra-ISD and inter-ISD.  As a
   path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available
   network path segments through *path-segment construction beacons
   (PCBs)*. A PCB is initiated by a core AS and then disseminated either
   within an ISD (to explore intra-ISD paths) or among core ASes (to
   explore core paths across different ISDs).  The PCBs accumulate
   cryptographically protected path- and forwarding information on AS-
   level, and store this information in the form of *hop fields (HFs)*.
   End hosts use the information from these PCBs/hop fields to create



de Kater & Perrig        Expires 30 October 2022                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   end-to-end forwarding paths for data packets, who carry this
   information in their packet headers.  This concept is called *packet-
   carried forwarding state (PCFS)*. The concept also supports multi-
   path communication among end hosts.

   The process of creating an end-to-end forwarding path consists of the
   following steps:

   1.  First, an AS discovers paths to other ASes, during the _path
       exploration_ (or beaconing) phase.

   2.  The AS then selects a few PCBs according to defined policies,
       transforms the selected PCBs into path segments, and registers
       these segments with a path infrastructure, thus making them
       available to other ASes.  This happens during the _path
       registration_ phase.

   3.  During the _path resolution_ phase, the actual creation of an
       end-to-end forwarding path to the destination takes place.  For
       this, an end host performs a. a _path lookup_ step, to obtain
       path segments, and b. a _path combination_ step, to combine the
       forwarding path from the segments.

   *ISD and AS numbering* SCION decouples end-host addressing from
   inter-domain routing.  Routing is based on the <ISD, AS> tuple,
   agnostic of end-host addressing.  Existing AS numbers are inherited
   from the current Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for
   additional SCION AS numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today.
   The end host local address is not used for inter-domain routing or
   forwarding, does not need to be globally unique, and can thus be an
   IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example.  A SCION address is
   therefore composed of the <ISD, AS, local address> 3-tuple.

1.2.3.   Infrastructure Components

   The *beacon service*, the *path service*, and the *certificate
   service* are the main infrastructure components within a SCION AS.
   Each service can be deployed redundantly, depending on the AS's size
   and type.  It is also possible to combine the services into one or
   more _control services_. _Internal routers_ forward packets inside
   the AS, while _border routers_ provide interconnectivity between
   ASes.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  The beacon service discovers path information.  It is responsible
      for generating, receiving, and propagating PCBs.  Periodically,
      the beacon service generates a set of PCBs, which are forwarded to
      its child ASes or neighboring core ASes.  The PCBs are flooded
      over policy-compliant paths to discover multiple paths between any
      pair of core ASes.

   *  The path service stores mappings from AS identifiers to sets of
      announced path segments.  The path service is organized as a
      hierarchical caching system similar to that of DNS.  Through the
      beacon service, ASes select the set of path segments through which
      they want to be reached, and they register them to the path
      service in the ISD core.

   *  The certificate service keeps cached copies of certificates and
      manages keys and certificates for securing inter-AS communication.
      The certificate service is queried by the beacon service when
      validating the authenticity of PCBs (i.e., when the beacon service
      lacks a certificate).

   _Border routers_ are deployed at the edge of SCION ASes.  The main
   task of border routers is to forward packets to a neighbor border
   router or the destination host within the AS.  While SCION takes care
   of intra-domain routing, it relies on existing routing protocols
   (e.g., IS-IS, OSPF, SDN) and communication fabric (e.g., IP, MPLS)
   for intra-domain forwarding.  _Internal routers_, therefore, do not
   need to be changed to support SCION.

1.3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Key Concepts

2.1.  Authentication

   SCION's control plane relies on a public-key infrastructure we call
   the *control-plane PKI (CP-PKI)*, in which each ISD defines its own
   roots of trust and policies in a file called trust root configuration
   (TRC).  A TRC is a signed collection of certificates, which also
   contains ISD-specific policies, for example, specifying how many
   signatures an updated TRC should contain to be valid.  Each SCION AS
   must hold a private key (to sign PCBs) and a certificate attesting
   that it is the rightful owner of the corresponding public key.  One

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   of the main roles of the TRC is thus enabling the verification of *AS
   certificates* and PCBs.

2.2.  Control Plane

   The SCION control plane discovers and distributes AS-level path
   segments.  A path segment encodes a network path at the granularity
   of inter-domain interfaces on either end of an inter-domain link
   connecting two consecutive ASes on a path.

   Each end-to-end path consists of up to three path segments: core
   path, up-path, and down-path segments.  Core-path segments refer to
   path segments containing only core ASes, an up-path segment is a path
   segment from a customer (leaf AS) to a provider (core AS) inside one
   ISD, and a down-path segment is a path segment from a provider (core
   AS) to a customer (leaf AS) inside an ISD.

   To address the sub-optimality of hierarchical routing, SCION
   introduces peering links and shortcuts.  In a shortcut, a path only
   contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at
   a non-core AS that is common to both paths.  Peering links can be
   added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar
   to today's Internet.

   Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on
   two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs
   core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and
   down-path segments.  The path segment construction process is
   referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon
   (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path
   segments.  Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by
   reversing the order of ASes in a segment.  The beaconing process in
   each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its
   Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks.

   Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between
   core ASes.  During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or
   propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other
   neighboring core ASes.












de Kater & Perrig        Expires 30 October 2022                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy,
   which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes.  For
   this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors
   (typically customer ASes).  Each non-core AS propagates the received
   PCBs to its respective customers.  This procedure continues until the
   PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all
   ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD.  Non-
   core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling
   valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the
   same peering link.

   A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path
   segments.  Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control
   service.  The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where
   information is fetched on-demand only.  A core AS's path server
   stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf
   ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.

2.3.  Data Plane

   Name resolution in SCION returns the <ISD, AS, local address>
   3-tuple.  Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the <ISD,
   AS> tuple.  Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with
   the received core- and down-path segments.

   Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and
   down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available
   between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment.
   Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent
   unauthorized path combinations.

   The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information
   about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS.  The
   hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path
   alteration.  This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS)
   replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need
   any local state on either paths or flows.
