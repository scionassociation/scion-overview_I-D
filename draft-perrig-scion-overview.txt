Abstract

   The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic
   expectations and is intertwined with many aspects of our society.
   Unfortunately, the security of today's Internet is far from
   commensurate with its importance as critical infrastructure.
   Additionally, the Internet has not primarily been built for high
   availability in the presence of malicious actors, and recent
   proposals to improve Internet security and availability have been
   constrained by the setup of the current architecture.

   The next-generation inter-network architecture SCION (Scalability,
   Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) aims to address
   the above-mentioned issues.  SCION was explicitly designed from the
   outset to offer availability and security by default.  The
   architecture provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit
   trust information for end-to-end communication.  It also enables
   multi-path routing between hosts.

   This document gives a high-level overview of the SCION architecture,
   including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and
   data plane.  As SCION is already in production use today, its
   conclude with an overview of SCION deployments.

1.  Introduction

   The Introduction section presents a very compact overview of the
   current Internet's most salient problems and shortcomings, which
   together are the reason for developing SCION: To address these issues
   in order to make the Internet more secure, reliable, transparent, and
   efficient.  The Introduction section then continues with an overview
   of SCION's main elements.

   The sections after the Introduction provide further insight into
   SCION's main concepts and features.  The document concludes with some
   concrete case studies where SCION has been applied successfully.

1.1.  Why SCION - Internet's Issues

1.1.1.  Issues with IP and BGP

   IP and BGP, the two protocols that define today's Internet
   architecture, have remained virtually unchanged since the
   standardization of IPv6 [RFC8200] and BGP-4 [RFC4271].  But the
   Internet has never stopped to expand and continually needs to
   accommodate new uses.  This has brought numerous issues to light.
   The following sections list these issues.

1.1.1.1.   Internet Protocol

   IP comes with the following drawbacks:

   *  *Lack of transparency and control*
      Today's Internet does not allow end hosts to select and verify
      paths.  It is also not possible to simultaneously use multiple
      distinct paths towards the same destination.

   *  *Stateful routers*
      The use of forwarding tables by IP routers is time-consuming,
      expensive, and energy-intensive.  Also, the constantly growing
      size of forwarding tables causes storage problems.  Additionally,
      routers that keep state for network information can suffer from
      denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exhausting the router's state
      [SCHUCHARD2011].

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


1.1.1.2.   BGP

   Just as IP, also BGP suffers from a number of shortcomings:

   *  *Outages*
      The unclear separation of control plane and the data plane as well
      as convergence problems can lead to severe outages problems of up
      to ten minutes or more [LABOVITZ2000].

   *  *Lack of fault isolation*
      Due to the lack of any routing hierarchy or isolation between
      different areas, a single faulty BGP speaker can affect routing in
      the entire world.

   *  *Poor scalability*
      The bigger the Internet becomes, the higher the workload of BGP
      gets, making it scale poorly.

   *  *Convergence*
      BGP convergence can be problematic, too.  In certain situations,
      BGP will never converge to a stable state, or converge only non-
      deterministically (see [GRIFFIN1999] and [RFC4264].  Convergence
      may also take too much time [SAHOO2009].

   *  *Single path*
      BGP only allows the selection of a single path to a destination.
      But having a multi-path choice can be welcome in several
      situations, e.g., in case of a link failure, or when a packet is
      routed over a too small and thus inefficient path.

   *  *Lack of security*
      BGP has no built-in security mechanisms and does not provide any
      tools for ASes to authenticate the information they receive
      through BGP update messages.  This opens up a multitude of attack
      opportunities--see Attacks (Section 1.1.3.2).

1.1.2.  Issues with RPKI and BGPsec

   RPKI and BGPsec try to address Internet's above-mentioned security
   shortcomings, see also [RFC6480] and [RFC8205].  However, RPKI and
   BGPsec have issues of their own, as shortly described below.

   *  *RPKI and Route Origin Authorizations*
      Unfortunately, the Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) provided by
      RPKI only prevent the simplest form of BGP hijacks, see Attacks
      (Section 1.1.3.2).

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  *Problems with BGPsec in partial deployment*
      BGPsec only provides full security when all ASes consistently use
      and enforce it.  In the current situation, where BGP is only
      partially deployed, it is not very effective.  It can even cause
      instabilities and is prone to downgrade attacks, see [LYCHEV2013].

   *  *Problems with BGPsec in full deployment*
      Also full deployment of BGPsec raises issues, such as the creation
      of wormholes and forwarding loops by attackers, or the
      introduction of circular dependencies, see [LI2014] and
      [COOPER2013].  RPKI and BGPsec together also cause issues for
      network sovereignty [ROTHENBERGER2017].  Additionally, BGPsec
      further exacerbates BGP's scalability issues.  Furthermore, prefix
      aggregation no longer works in BGPsec because the digital
      signatures are not aggregated.

1.1.3.  Other Internet Issues

1.1.3.1.  Lack of Authentication

   Authenticating digital data is becoming increasingly important, as
   adversaries exploit the absence of authentication to inject malicious
   information.  However, implementation of authentication is not strong
   in today's Internet:

   *  Internet does not support sharing a secret key between two end
      hosts for secure end-to-end communication.

   *  Infrastructures added to provide authentication, such as RPKI/
      BGPsec, TLS [RFC8446], and DNSSEC [RFC4033], are all sensitive to
      the compromise of a single entity.

   *  The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) does not even have an
      authenticated counterpart, see [RFC4443] and [RFC0791].

1.1.3.2.   Attacks

   The current Internet architecture offers little to no protection
   against several attacks, such as prefix hijacking, spoofing, denial
   of service, DNS hijacking, and composed versions thereof.
   Unfortunately, BGP hijacks are still possible when RPKI is deployed
   and are only resolved in a full deployment of BGPsec.  Additionally,
   in settings where route origin validation (ROV) is deployed, Morillo
   et al. recently point out several new attacks: hidden hijack, non-
   routed prefix hijack, and super-prefix hijack of non-routed prefixes
   [MORILLO2021].

1.2.  SCION Overview

   SCION has been designed to address the security issues of today's
   Internet depicted in the previous section Why SCION - Internet's
   Issues (Section 1.1).  This section gives a high-level description of
   SCION's main elements, providing a basic understanding of this next-
   generation inter-network architecture.

1.2.1.  Network Architecture and Naming

   SCION's main goal is to offer highly available and efficient point-
   to-point packet delivery--even in the presence of actively malicious
   entities.  To achieve scalability and sovereignty, SCION organizes
   existing ASes into groups of independent routing planes, called
   *Isolation Domains (ISD)*. An AS can be a member of multiple ISDs.
   All ASes in an ISD agree on a set of trust roots, called the *Trust
   Root Configuration (TRC)*, ensuring that network traffic only flows
   on policy-compliant paths.  The ISD is governed by a set of *core
   ASes*, which provide connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust
   roots.  Typically, the 3-10 largest ISPs of an ISD form the ISD's
   core.

   Isolation domains serve the following purposes:

   *  They allow SCION to support trust heterogeneity, as each ISD can
      independently define its roots of trust;

   *  They provide transparency for trust relationships;

   *  They isolate the routing process within an ISD from external
      influences such as attacks and misconfigurations; and

   *  They improve the scalability of the routing protocol by separating
      it into a process within and one between ISDs.

   ISDs provide natural isolation of routing failures and
   misconfigurations, give endpoints strong control over both inbound
   and outbound traffic, provide meaningful and enforceable trust, and
   enable scalable routing updates with high path-freshness.

   *Links*
   There are three types of links in SCION: core links, parent-child
   links, and peering links.

   *  A *core link* can only exist between two core ASes.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   *  A *parent-child link* requires that at least one of the two
      connected ASes is a non-core AS.  ASes with a parent-child link
      usually belong to the same entity or have a provider-customer
      relationship.

   *  A *peering link* also includes at least non-core AS.  A peering
      link exists between ASes with a (standard or paid) relationship.

1.2.2.  Routing

   SCION operates on two routing levels: intra-ISD and inter-ISD.  As a
   path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available
   network path segments through *path-segment construction beacons
   (PCBs)*. A PCB is initiated by a core AS and then disseminated either
   within an ISD (to explore intra-ISD paths) oder among core ASes (to
   explore core paths across different ISDs).  The PCBs accumulate
   cryptographically protected path- and forwarding information on AS-
   level, and store this information in the form of *hop fields (HFs)*.
   End hosts use the information from these PCBs/hop fields to create
   end-to-end forwarding paths for data packets, who carry this
   information in their packet headers.  This concept is called *packet-
   carried forwarding state (PCFS)*. The concept also enables multi-path
   communication among end hosts.

   The process of creating a end-to-end forwarding path contains the
   following steps:

   1.  First, an AS discovers paths to other ASes, during the _path
       exploration_ (or beaconing) phase.

   2.  The AS then selects a few PCBs according to defined selection
       criteria, transforms the selected PCBs into path segments, and
       registers these segments with a path infrastructure, thus making
       them available to other ASes.  This happens during the _path
       registration_ phase.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   3.  During the _path resolution_ process, the actual creation of an
       end-to-end forwarding path to the destination takes place.  For
       this, an end host performs
       a. a _path lookup_ step, to obtain path segments, and
       b. a _path combination_ step, to combine the forwarding path from
       the segments.

   *ISD and AS numbering*
   Routing is based on the <ISD, AS> tuple, agnostic of local
   addressing.  Existing AS numbers are inherited from the current
   Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for additional SCION AS
   numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today.  Host addressing
   extends the network address with a local address, forming the <ISD,
   AS, local address> 3-tuple.  The local address is not used in inter-
   domain routing or forwarding, does not need to be globally unique,
   and can thus be an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example.

1.2.3.   Infrastructure Components

   The *beacon service*, the *path service*, and the *certificate
   service* are the main infrastructure components of the SCION network
   architecture.  Each AS can have one or more servers per service,
   depending on the AS's size and type.  It is also possible to combine
   the services into one or more _control services_. _internal routers_
   forward packets inside the AS, while _border routers_ provide
   interconnectivity between ASes.

   *  The beacon service discovers path information.  It is responsible
      for generating, receiving, and propagating PCBs.  Periodically,
      the beacon service generates a set of PCBs, which it forwards to
      its child ASes or neighboring core ASes.  The PCBs are flooded
      over policy-compliant paths to discover multiple paths between any
      pair of core ASes.

   *  The path service stores mappings from AS identifiers to sets of
      announced path segments.  The path service is organized as a
      hierarchical caching system similar to that of DNS.  Through the
      beacon service, ASes select the set of path segments through which
      they want to be reached, and they upload them to the path service
      in the ISD core.

   *  The certificate service keeps cached copies of certificates and
      manages keys and certificates for securing inter-AS communication.
      The certificate service is queried by the beacon service when
      validating the authenticity of PCBs (i.e., when the beacon service
      lacks a certificate).

   _Border routers_ connect different ASes supporting SCION.  The main
   task of border routers is to forward packets to the next border
   router or the destination host within the AS.  Since SCION can
   operate using any intra-AS routing protocol (e.g., IS-IS, OSPF, SDN)
   and communication fabric (e.g., IP, MPLS), the _internal routers_ do
   not need to be changed to support SCION.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Key Concepts

2.1.  Authentication

   SCION's control plane relies on a public-key infrastructure we call
   the *control-plane PKI (CP-PKI)*, in which each ISD defines its own
   roots of trust and policies in a file called trust root configuration
   (TRC).  A TRC is a signed collection of certificates, which also
   contains ISD-specific policies, for example, specifying how many
   signatures an updated TRC should contain to be valid.  Each SCION AS
   must hold a private key (to sign PCBs) and a certificate attesting
   that it is the rightful owner of the corresponding public key.  One
   of the main roles of the TRC is thus enabling the verification of *AS
   certificates* and PCBs.

2.2.  Control Plane

   The SCION control plane discovers and distributes AS-level path
   segments.  A path segment encodes a network path at the granularity
   of inter-domain interfaces on either end of an inter-domain link
   connecting two consecutive ASes on a path.

   Each end-to-end path consists of up to three path segments: core
   path, up-path, and down-path segments.  Core-path segments refer to
   path segments containing only core ASes, an up-path segment is a path
   segment from a customer (leaf AS) to a provider (core AS) inside one
   ISD, and a down-path segment is a path segment from a provider (core
   AS) to a customer (leaf AS) inside an ISD.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   To address the sub-optimality of hierarchical routing, SCION
   introduces peering links and shortcuts.  In a shortcut, a path only
   contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at
   a non-core AS that is common to both paths.  Peering links can be
   added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar
   to today's Internet.

   Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on
   two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs
   core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and
   down-path segments.  The path segment construction process is
   referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon
   (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path
   segments.  Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by
   reversing the order of ASes in a segment.  The beaconing process in
   each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its
   Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks.

   Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between
   core ASes.  During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or
   propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other
   neighboring core ASes.

   Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy,
   which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes.  For
   this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors
   (typically customer ASes).  Each non-core AS propagates the received
   PCBs to its respective customers.  This procedure continues until the
   PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all
   ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD.  Non-
   core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling
   valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the
   same peering link.

   A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path
   segments.  Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control
   service.  The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where
   information is fetched on-demand only.  A core AS's path server
   stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf
   ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.

2.3.  Data Plane

   Name resolution in SCION returns the <ISD, AS, local address>
   3-tuple.  Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the <ISD,
   AS> tuple.  Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with
   the received core- and down-path segments.

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and
   down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available
   between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment.
   Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent
   unauthorized path combinations.

   The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information
   about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS.  The
   hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path
   alteration.  This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS)
   replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need
   any local state on either paths or flows.
