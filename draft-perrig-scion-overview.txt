Abstract

   The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic
   expectations and is intertwined with many aspects of our society.
   Unfortunately, the security of today's Internet is not commensurate
   with its importance as critical infrastructure.  Additionally, the
   Internet has not primarily been built for high availability in the
   presence of malicious actors, and recent proposals to improve
   Internet security and availability have been constrained by the setup
   of the current architecture.

   The next-generation inter-network architecture SCION (Scalability,
   Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) aims to address
   the above-mentioned issues.  SCION was explicitly designed from the
   outset to offer availability and security by default.  The
   architecture provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit
   trust information for end-to-end communication.  It also enables
   multi-path routing between hosts.

   The document gives a high-level overview of the SCION architecture,
   including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and
   data plane.  As SCION is already in production use today, we conclude
   with an overview of SCION deployments.

1.  Introduction

   The Introduction section briefly presents the key concepts of the
   next-generation Internet architecture SCION.  We start this section
   with an explanation of why we designed SCION in the first place.

   The sections after the Introduction provide further insight into
   SCION's main concepts and features.  We complete the document with
   some concrete case studies where SCION has been applied successfully.

1.1.  Why SCION?

   Two protocols effectively define today's Internet architecture: the
   Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC8200], [RFC0791] and the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271].  These protocols have remained virtually
   unchanged since the standardization of IPv6 [RFC2460] and BGP-4
   [RFC1653] in the 1990s.  However, as the Internet continued to expand
   and needed to accommodate new uses, numerous issues came to light.
   This section presents a compact overview of the Internet's most
   salient problems and shortcomings, which together are the reason why
   we developed SCION: To address these issues in order to make the
   Internet more secure, reliable, transparent, and efficient.

1.1.1.  Internet Protocol

   IP is one of the fundamental protocols of the Internet, as it enables
   the forwarding of packets between end hosts.  Its first major
   version, IPv4, was specified in 1981 [RFC0791] and its (non-backward
   compatible) successor, IPv6, was introduced in 1998 [RFC2460].  IP
   enables the transmission of packets between a source and a
   destination along a single path that is opaque from the end host's
   perspective.  To forward packets, end hosts (as well as routers) do
   not need a complete path, but only a table to determine the next hop
   solely based on the destination address.  Neither senders nor
   receivers can typically influence the path that their packets take.
   This approach is simple, but it also comes with many drawbacks:

   *Lack of transparency and control*

Internet-Draft                  SCION I-D                     April 2022


   Being able to select and verify the path that packets take is
   desirable in many situations.  End hosts might want to avoid packets
   being routed through adversarial or untrusted networks, or they might
   want to choose the most suitable path with regard to a specific
   metric (e.g., latency or bandwidth).  Unfortunately, IP does not
   offer such an option.  Although systems that enable loose and strict
   source routing have been proposed, these extensions are not commonly
   supported in today's networks.  It is also not possible to
   simultaneously use multiple distinct paths towards the same
   destination--even though multipath communication offers numerous
   benefits, which we will encounter throughout the book.

   *Stateful routers*

   IP routers maintain forwarding tables to determine the next hop of a
   received packet.  This basic requirement has undesirable
   consequences.  Performing a forwarding-table lookup for every packet
   is a time-consuming operation.  Therefore, high-performance
   networking equipment typically relies on ternary content-addressable
   memory (TCAM) hardware, which is expensive and energy-intensive.
   Moreover, the constantly growing size of forwarding tables, partially
   due to the slow but steady deployment of IPv6, poses a problem for
   routers, as the storage capacity of TCAM hardware is limited.
   Routers that keep state for network information can also suffer from
   denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exhausting the router's state (460).

1.1.5.  Answer

   Solutions should be/have:

   *  Available in the presence of adversaries

   *  Transparent and controllable

   *  Efficient and scalable

   *  Extensible and algorithm agile

   *  Deployable

   *  Formally verifiable

1.2.  Key Concepts

1.2.1.  Network Structure and Naming

   SCION organizes existing ASes into groups of independent routing
   planes, called isolation domains (ISDs), which interconnect to
   provide global connectivity.  Isolation domains provide natural
   isolation of routing failures and misconfigurations, give endpoints
   strong control over both inbound and outbound traffic, provide
   meaningful and enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates
   with high path-freshness.

   As a path-based architecture, SCION end hosts learn about available
   network path segments, and combine them into end-to-end paths that
   are carried in packet headers.  SCION also enables multi-path
   communication among end hosts.

   SCION reuses the Autonomous Systems (AS) structure, and ensures that
   network traffic only flows on policy-compliant paths.  To achieve
   scalability and sovereignty, Isolation Domains (ISD) are introduced.
   An ISD groups ASes that agree on a set of trust roots, called the
   Trust Root Configuration (TRC).  An AS can be a member of multiple
   ISDs.  The ISD is governed by a set of core ASes, which provide
   connectivity to other ISDs and manage the trust roots.  Typically,
   the 3-10 largest ISPs of an ISD form the ISD's core.

   Routing is based on the <ISD, AS> tuple, agnostic of local
   addressing.  Existing AS numbers are inherited from the current
   Internet, but a 48-bit namespace allows for additional SCION AS
   numbers beyond the 32-bit space in use today.  Host addressing
   extends the network address with a local address, forming the <ISD,
   AS, local address> 3-tuple.  The local address is not used in inter-
   domain routing or forwarding, does not need to be globally unique,
   and can thus be an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address, for example.

1.2.2.  Authentication

   Control-Plane PKI/TRC

1.2.3.  Control Plane

   The SCION control plane discovers and distributes AS-level path
   segments.  A path segment encodes a network path at the granularity
   of inter-domain interfaces on either end of an inter-domain link
   connecting two consecutive ASes on a path.

   Each end-to-end path consists of up to three path segments: corepath,
   up-path, and down-path segments.  Core-path segments refer to path
   segments containing only core ASes, an up-path segment is a path
   segment from a customer (leaf AS) to a provider (core AS) inside one
   ISD, and a down-path segment is a path segment from a provider (core
   AS) to a customer (leaf AS) inside an ISD.

   To address the suboptimality of hierarchical routing, SCION
   introduces peering links and shortcuts.  In a shortcut, a path only
   contains an up-path and a down-path segment, which can cross over at
   a non-core AS that is common to both paths.  Peering links can be
   added to up- or down-path segments, resulting in an operation similar
   to today's Internet.

   Routing (or path segment construction) is conducted hierarchically on
   two levels: (1) among all core ASes of all ISDs, which constructs
   core-path segments, and (2) within each ISD, which constructs up- and
   down-path segments.  The path segment construction process is
   referred to as beaconing, where a Path-segment Construction Beacon
   (PCB) is initiated by core ASes to iteratively construct path
   segments.  Up- and down-path segments are interchangeable, simply by
   reversing the order of ASes in a segment.  The beaconing process in
   each AS is performed by its beacon server which is a part of its
   Control Service (CS), that performs control-plane-related tasks.

   Core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between
   core ASes.  During core beaconing, a core AS either initiates PCBs or
   propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to all other
   neighboring core ASes.

   Intra-ISD beaconing is the second level of the beaconing hierarchy,
   which creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes.  For
   this, core ASes create PCBs and send them to their non-core neighbors
   (typically customer ASes).  Each non-core AS propagates the received
   PCBs to its respective customers.  This procedure continues until the
   PCB reaches an AS without any customer (leaf AS) and as a result, all
   ASes receive path segments to reach the core ASes of their ISD.  Non-
   core ASes can include their peering links in the PCBs, enabling
   valley-free forwarding if both up- and down-path segments contain the
   same peering link.

   A global path server infrastructure is used to disseminate path
   segments.  Each AS contains a path server as a part of the control
   service.  The infrastructure bears similarities to DNS, where
   information is fetched on-demand only.  A core AS's path server
   stores all the intra-ISD path segments that were registered by leaf
   ASes of its own ISD, and core-path segments to reach other core ASes.

1.2.4.  Data Plane

   Name resolution in SCION returns the <ISD, AS, local address>
   3-tuple.  Core- and down-path segments are fetched based on the <ISD,
   AS> tuple.  Hosts can then combine one of their up-path segments with
   the received core- and down-path segments.

   Shortcut paths that avoid a core AS are possible, if the up- and
   down-path contain the same AS, or if a peering link is available
   between an AS in the up-path and an AS in the down-path segment.
   Cryptographic protections ensure authentic path segments and prevent
   unauthorized path combinations.

   The path segments contain compact hop-fields, that encode information
   about which interfaces may be used to enter and leave an AS.  The
   hop-fields are cryptographically protected, preventing path
   alteration.  This so-called Packet-Carried Forwarding State (PCFS)
   replaces signaling to use a path, ensuring that routers do not need
   any local state on either paths or flows.
