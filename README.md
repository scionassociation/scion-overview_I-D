# How to Handle Figures

Currently, when writing in Markdown, you can only add ASCII Art figures to Internet Drafts and RFCs.
This section shortly describes how to proceed.


## Creating ASCII Art Figures

- The easiest way to create an ASCII Art figure is to use an ASCII Art editor, such as Monodraw.
- After drawing the figure in the editor, export it in text format (_.txt_).
- Save the text file with the figure in the _images_ folder of the repository.


## Inserting the Figure in the Markdown File

- Copy the ASCII art figure out of the text file.
- Paste it into the desired place in the Markdown file.<br>
- Do not forget to put the figure between four tildes, like this: 

~\~\~\~\
_ascii art figure_<br>
~\~\~\~

This will give the following (sample) result: 

~~~~
  __
<(o )___
 ( ._> /
  `---'
~~~~


> **Good to know**
> <br>
> To prevent your Markdown editor from automatically removing white spaces in your ASCII Art figure, disable the _Auto Indent on Paste_ feature. 
> In Atom, you do this in the **Editor Settings** of the **Preferences** menu.


## Referencing Figures

To refer to a figure in your Internet Draft or RFC, you must first add a reference name to the figure. Optionally, you could add a caption, too. You can then link to the figure from another place in the document by referring to the reference name. 

Perform the next steps:

- Define a reference name and optionally a caption text ("title") and place this in-between curly brackets:
<br> {: #refname title="My caption"}
- Place the reference definition directly under the tildes that build the lower border of the figure. Like this:<br>
~\~\~\~ <br>
_ascii art figure_ <br>
~\~\~\~ <br>
{: #refname title="My caption"}
- Now add two pairs of curly brackets to the place from where you want to link to the figure, and enter the reference name between the brackets, like this: {{refname}}
